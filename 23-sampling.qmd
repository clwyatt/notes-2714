title: "Sampling CT Signals"
---

Up until now in the course we have focused on either CT or DT signals
and systems. Practical systems though often are hybrid and require
conversion between DT and CT signals. For example a CT audio signal
might be converted to a DT audio signal for storage and/or transmission,
and at a later time or location converted back to a CT signal for
playback through a speaker.

It is also common to design a CT system and then implement it as a DT
system. Advantages of this approach are e.g. such implementations are
less susceptible to component variations, require no tuning a build
time, are easier to change (firmware or software update), easier to
prototype, and more easily use encryption.

In this lecture we focus on *sampling* of CT signals to produce a DT
signal $x[n] = x(nT)$ with sample index $n$ and sample time $T$. In the
next lecture we consider the case of converting from a DT to CT signal.

## Sampling Theory

The process of sampling is to produce a DT signal $x[n]$ from a CT
signal $x(t)$ by sampling time at regular intervals $T\in \mathbb{R}^+$
called the *sample-time*, or equivalently sampling at a frequency of
$\tfrac{1}{T}$ Hz or $\tfrac{2\pi}{T}$ rad/s. Mathematically this is
simple to express in the time domain as $x[n] = x(nT)$, however we seek
a system that can perform this task.

Recall the impulse train is the periodic signal
$$x_1(t) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-nT_0)$$ with period
$T_0$ and frequency $\omega_0 = \tfrac{2\pi}{T_0}$. The exponential CT
Fourier series of the impulse train is given by
$$x_1(t) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n e^{j\tfrac{2\pi}{T_0}nt}$$
where the Fourier series coefficients are
$$a_n = \frac{1}{T_0} \int\limits_{-\frac{T_0}{2}}^{\frac{T_0}{2}} \delta(t) e^{-jn\omega_0 t} \; dt = \frac{1}{T_0}$$
Now, lets take the Fourier Transform of the Fourier series
representation $$\begin{aligned}
X_1(j\omega) &= \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{T_0} e^{j\tfrac{2\pi}{T_0}nt}e^{j\omega t}\; dt\\
&= \frac{1}{T_0} \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{j\tfrac{2\pi}{T_0}nt}e^{j\omega t}\; dt\\
&= \frac{2\pi}{T_0} \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(\omega - \omega_0 n)
\end{aligned}$$ also an impulse train in the frequency domain. Now
suppose we have another signal $x_2(t)$ and we multiply $x_1(t)$ and
$x_2(t)$ to get a signal $y(t)$.
$$y(t) = x_1(t) \cdot x_2(t) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x_2(t) \delta(t-nT_0) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x_2(nT_0) \delta(t-nT_0)$$
Since $y(t)$ is non-zero only at the locations of the delta functions,
we can treat $y(nT_0) = x_2(nT_0)$ as the DT signal $x_2[n]$. This is
illustrated below

![Illustration of sampling a CT signal by multiplication with the impulse train.](figures/fig23_1){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

Equivalently in the frequency domain the modulation theorem gives
$$y(t) = x_1(t) \cdot x_2(t) \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\longleftrightarrow} \frac{1}{2\pi} X_1(j\omega) * X_2(j\omega) = Y(j\omega)$$
Lets do the convolution $$\begin{aligned}
  Y(j\omega) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} X_1(j\omega) * X_2(j\omega)\\
  &=  \frac{1}{2\pi} \left[  \frac{2\pi}{T_0} \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(\omega - \omega_0 n) \right] * X_2(j\omega)\\
  &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \frac{2\pi}{T_0} \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(\omega - \omega^\prime - \omega_0 n) X_2(j\omega^\prime) \; d\omega^\prime\\
  &= \frac{1}{T_0} \sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} X_2(j(\omega - n\omega_0)) 
\end{aligned}$$ Thus the sampling process in the frequency domain causes
periodic replication of the Fourier transform of the signal being
sampled, $x_2(t)$, which are sometimes called *images*. This signal
$Y(j\omega)$ is periodic in $\omega_0 = \tfrac{2\pi}{T_0}$ *radians per
second* and corresponds to the DT Fourier Transform of
$x_2[n]  \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\longleftrightarrow} X_2\left(e^{j\omega}\right)$,
which is periodic in $2\pi$ *radians per sample time*.

To help us visualize this, suppose that the signal
$x_2(t)  \stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\longleftrightarrow} X_2(j\omega)$ is
*band-limited* to $B$ Hz, that is $X_2(j\omega) = 0$ for all frequencies
outside the band $-2\pi B < \omega < 2\pi B$. This is shown
schematically as the magnitude spectrum below:

![A bandlimited signal to be sampled, shown in the frequency domain.](figures/fig23_2){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

After sampling ($y(t) = x_1(t)\cdot x_2(t)$) and assuming
$\omega_0 > 4\pi B$ the spectrum of the sampled signal is:

![A bandlimited signal sampled above the Nyquist rate, shown in the frequency domain.](figures/fig23_3){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

If instead $\omega_0 < 4\pi B$ the images overlap and we get *aliasing*,
where high frequency content gets added to the lower frequency content.
This is shown below with the lighter lines showing the images and the
heavier line showing their sum.

As we will see next time, to reconstruct the signal $x_2[n]$ back to
$x_2(t)$ we need to ensure that $\omega_0 > 4\pi B$ rad/s or
equivalently $f_0 > 2 B$ Hz, which requires the sample time
$T_0 < \tfrac{1}{2B}$ seconds. This is called the *Nyquist* sample
rate/frequency.

Consider a signal representing a musical chord (an additive mixture of
three notes)
$$x(t) = \sin(2\pi\cdot (261) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (329) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (392) t)$$
Suppose it is sampled at a frequency of $f_0 = 1$ kHz. Then there is no
aliasing into the frequency range $(0, 500)$ Hz. After reconstruction
$x(t)$ would be unmodified. Suppose instead it is sampled at $f_0 = 500$
Hz. Then the signal component at $261$ Hz aliases to $239 = 500-261$ Hz,
the signal component at $329$ Hz aliases to $171 = 500-329$ Hz, and the
signal component at $392$ Hz aliases to $108 = 500-392$ Hz. When
reconstructed, the signal now has an additional 3 tones mixed in at
audible frequencies, but do not correspond to (Western) musical notes,
i.e.
$$x(t) = \sin(2\pi\cdot (108) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (171) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (239) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (261) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (329) t) + \sin(2\pi\cdot (392) t)$$

## Practical Sampling

Sampling in practice requires addressing three issues. First, we cannot
generate the impulse train, but can only approximate it. Second, digital
signals must have a fixed bit width so we have to convert the real
signal value to a *quantized* one. Lastly, since in general we have no
control over the input signal means we need to ensure the signal is
approximately band-limited before sampling.

### Sample and Hold

Sampling is typically accomplished using a circuit called a
*sample-and-hold*, schematically illustrated below.

![Block diagram of a sample and hold circuit, part of an analog-to-digital converter.](figures/fig23_5){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

The CT signal is applied to the input of the first op-amp buffer. The
output of this first buffer is switched into a charging capacitor for
the *sample time*, then disconnected (high impedance) at regular
intervals for the *hold time*, typically using a MOSFET switch. The
effect is the capacitor is charged to the current value of $x(t)$ during
the sample-time, which it maintains during the hold-time, the value of
which is bufered by the second op-amp. This can be mathematically
modeled as a pulse train with a width equal to the sample time rather
than as an impulse train.

### Quantization

To quantize the signal after the sample-and-hold into $N$ bits, several
strategies can be used. One popular approach is called *successive
approximation*, illustrated below

![Block Diagram of a quantizer using a counter to perform successive approximation.](figures/fig23_6){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

The current quantized digital value is held in a counter connected to a
clock signal. The direction of the counter (up or down) is controlled by
a comparator connected to the output of the sample and hold and the
current counter output and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, usually a
resistor ladder) that converts it back to an analog value. If the DAC
value is less than the held value, the counter counts up, if the DAC
value is greater than the held value the counter counts down. In this
fashion the counter output tracks the held value after a settling time
required for convergence, at which point the counter value is clocked
into a register for storage.

### Anti-aliasing

Before the sample and hold we need to include a filter to limit the
bandwidth. This can be accomplished by a CT low-pass filter called an
*anti-aliasing* filter whose cutoff frequency in the ideal case is
$\omega_c = 2\pi B$. As we saw in lecture 24 ideal filters cannot be
implemented, thus we specify the anti-aliasing filter as a pass-band
gain/frequency and a stop-band gain/frequency. Since the transition band
is non-zero for a practical filter, this means we have to either lower
the pass-band relative to the ideal or increase the sample rate. In the
best case, the filter should have a stop-band frequency at half the
sampling frequency with the order of the filter and pass-band frequency
adjusted as needed. Alternatively the gain that defines the stop-band
can be relaxed. This gives a desired frequency response magnitude that
looks like the following.
