These notes are not comprehensive – often additional material and insights are covered during class.\nThis material is well covered in the official course text “Oppenheim, A. V., Willsky, A. S., and Nawab, S. H. Signals and Systems. ii, Essex UK: Prentice Hall Pearson, 1996.” (abbreviated OW). This is an older, but very good book. However there are many, many texts that cover the same material. reading a textbook is one of the most important things you can do to learn this material.

Feel free to share these with your class but you are under no obligation to do so. There are many alternative ways to motivate and develop this material and you should use the way that you like best. This is just how I do it.\nEach chapter corresponds to a “Topic Learning Objective” and would typically be covered in one class meeting on a Tuesday-Thursday or Monday-Wednesday schedule. Note CT and DT topics are taught interleaved rather than in separate blocks. This gets the student used to going back and forth between the two signal and system types. We introduce time-domain topics first, followed by (real) frequency domain topics, using complex frequency domain for sinusoidal analysis only and as a bridge. Detailed analysis and application of Laplace and Z-transforms is left to ECE 3704.",

This is a Sallen-Key filter, a second-order system commonly use to select frequencies from a signal:\n\nThere are two signals we can easily identify, the input signal as the voltage applied across \\(x(t)\\), and the output voltage measured across \\(y(t)\\). We build on your circuits course by viewing this circuit as an implementation of a more abstract linear system. We see how it can be viewed as a frequency selective filter. We will see how to answer questions such as: how do we choose the values of the resistors and capacitors to select the frequencies we are interested in? and how do we determine what those frequencies are?\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nRobotic Joint. This is a Linear, Time-Invariant model of a DC motor, a mixture of electrical and mechanical components.\n\nHow do we convert the motor into a servo for use in a robotic joint?

For example, given an electrical circuit and an applied voltage or current, what are the voltages and currents across and through the various components.\nWhen we know either the input and desired output and seek the system to perform this transformation,\n\nor we know the system description and output and desire the input that would generate the output,\n\nwe have a design problem.\nThis course focuses on modeling and analysis with applications to electrical circuits and devices for measurement and control of the physical world and is broadly applicable to all ECE majors. Some Examples:\n\nControls, Robotics, & Autonomy: LTI systems theory forms the basis of perception and control of machines.\nCommunications & Networking: LTI systems theory forms the basis of transmission and reception of signals, e.g. AM and FM radio.\nMachine Learning: LTI systems are often used to pre-process samples or to create basis functions to improve learning.\nEnergy & Power Electronic Systems: linear circuits are often modeled as LTI systems.\n\nSubsequent courses, e.g. ECE 3704, focus more on analysis and design.",

This lecture gives an introduction to continuous-time signals as functions. You learn how to characterize such signals in a number of ways and are introduced to two very important signals: the unit impulse and the complex exponential.\nIn order to reason about signals mathematically we need a representation or model. Signals are modeled as functions, mappings between sets \\[\nf: A \\rightarrow B\n\\] where \\(A\\) is a set called the domain and \\(B\\) is a set called the range.\nThe most basic classification of signals depends on the sets that makeup the domain and co-domain. We will be interested in two versions of the domain, the reals denoted \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the integers denoted \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). We will be interested in two versions of the co-domain, the reals \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the set of complex numbers \\(\\mathbb{C}\\).\nSome other possibilities:\nThe co-domain can also be complex.\nSince the domains \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) are usually interpreted as time, we will call these time-domain signals. In the time-domain, when the co-domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) we call these real signals. All physical signals are real.

    "text": "2.5 Unit Impulse Function\nAn important CT signal is the unit impulse function, also called the “delta” \\(\\delta\\) function for the symbol traditionally used to define it. Applying this signal to a system models a “kick” to that system. For example, consider striking a tuning fork. The reason this signal is so important is that it will turn out that the response of the system to this input tells us all we need to know about a linear, time-invariant system!\n\n\nExample\n\n\nCT Impulse Function. The CT impulse function is not really a function at all, but a mathematical object called a “distribution”. Some equivalent definitions:\n\\[\n\\delta(t) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0}\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n  \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon} & |t| &lt; \\epsilon\\\\\n  0 & \\text{else}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\delta(t) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\epsilon} e^{-\\frac{t^2}{2\\epsilon^2}}\n\\] Note the area under each definition is always one.\n\n\nIn practice we can often use the following definition and some properties, without worrying about the distribution functions. \\[\n\\delta(t) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n  0 & t \\neq 0\\\\\n  \\infty & t = 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\] which we draw as a vertical arrow in plots:\n\n\n\nThe delta function shown as a graph.\n\n\nNote the height of the arrow is arbitrary. Often in the case of a non-unit impulse function the area is written in parenthesis near the arrow tip.\nThe following properties of the impulse function will be used often.\n\nThe area under the unit impulse is unity since by definition \\[\n\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t) \\; dt = 1\n\\]\nSampling property: \\(x(t)\\delta(t-t_0) = x(t_0)\\delta(t-t_0)\\)\nSifting Property: \\[\n\\int\\limits_{a}^{b} x(t)\\delta(t-t_0) \\; dt = x(t_0)\n\\] for any \\(a &lt; t_0 &lt; b\\).\n\nWe previously defined the unit step function. The impulse can be defined in terms of the step: \\[\n\\delta(t) = \\frac{du}{dt}\n\\] and vice-versa \\[\nu(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} \\delta(\\tau) \\; d\\tau\n\\] using the notion of distributions, e.g.\n\\[\nu(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} \\delta(\\tau) \\; d\\tau = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\epsilon} e^{-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2\\epsilon^2}} \\; d\\tau = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{2}\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nThe step and impulse function are related, but in many cases finding the response of a system to a step input is easier.\nWe can apply additional transformations to the impulse and step functions to get other useful signals, e.g.\n\nramp \\[\nr(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} u(\\tau) \\; d\\tau = tu(t)\n\\]\ncausal pulse of width \\(\\epsilon\\) \\[\np(t) = u(t) - u(t-\\epsilon)\n\\]\nnon-causal pulse of width \\(2\\epsilon\\) \\[\n    p(t) = u(t+\\epsilon) - u(t-\\epsilon)\n\\]",

    "text": "3.5 DT Complex Exponential\nThe DT Complex Exponential is defined in a similar fashion the the CT version, but with some important differences. The general DT complex exponential is given by the expression: \\[x[n] = Ce^{\\beta n}\\] where in general \\(C \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) and \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}\\). It is sometimes convenient (for reasons we will see later) to write this as \\[x[n] = C \\alpha^n\\] where \\(\\alpha = e^{j\\theta}\\) is a complex number \\(\\alpha = \\cos(\\theta) + j\\sin(\\theta)\\).\nWe now examine several special cases.\n\n3.5.1 DT Complex Exponential: real case\nLet \\(C\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) be real, then there are four intervals of interest:\n\n\\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\)\n\\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\)\n\\(-1 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 0\\)\n\\(\\alpha &lt; -1\\)\n\nEach of these are shown in Figure 3.2.\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nn = np.linspace(-6, 6, 13);\n\nf = plt.figure()\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\nalpha = 2\nplt.stem(n, np.power(alpha, n))\nplt.xlabel('$n$')\nplt.ylabel('$x[n]$')\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\nalpha = 0.5\nplt.stem(n, np.power(alpha, n))\nplt.xlabel('$n$')\nplt.ylabel('$x[n]$')\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\nalpha = -0.5\nplt.stem(n, np.power(alpha, n))\nplt.xlabel('$n$')\nplt.ylabel('$x[n]$')\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\nalpha = -2\nplt.stem(n, np.power(alpha, n))\nplt.xlabel('$n$')\nplt.ylabel('$x[n]$')\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: DT Complex Exponential: real case, four intervals of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 DT Complex Exponential: sinusoidal case\nLet \\(C = 1\\). When \\(\\beta\\) is purely imaginary, \\(\\beta = j\\omega_0\\) \\[x[n] = e^{j\\omega_0 n}\\]\nAs in CT, by Euler’s identity: \\[e^{j\\omega_0 n} = \\cos(\\omega_0 n) + j\\sin(\\omega_0 n)\\] and \\[\\Re(x[n]) = \\cos(\\omega_0 n) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( e^{j\\omega_0 n} + e^{-j\\omega_0 n} \\right)\\] \\[\\Im(x[n]) = \\sin(\\omega_0 n) = \\frac{1}{2j}\\left( e^{j\\omega_0 n} - e^{-j\\omega_0 n} \\right)\\]\nThe energy and power are the same as for the CT complex sinusoid: \\(E_x = \\infty\\) and \\(P_x = 1\\).\n\n\n3.5.3 DT Complex Exponential: sinusoidal case with phase shift\nThe general DT sinusoid is\n\\[x[n] = A\\cos(\\omega_0 n + \\phi)\\]\n\n\\(A\\) is called the amplitude\n\\(\\phi\\) is called the phase shift\n\\(\\omega_0\\) is now in radians (assuming \\(n\\) is dimensionless)\n\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nn = np.linspace(-10, 10, 21);\nx = np.cos(2*np.pi/10*n + np.pi/8)\n\nf = plt.figure()\n\nplt.stem(n, x)\nplt.xlabel('$n$')\nplt.ylabel('$x[n]$')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor CT sinusoids as \\(\\omega_0\\) increases the signal oscillates faster and faster. However for DT sinusoids there is a \"fastest\" oscillation.\n\\[e^{j\\omega_0 n}\\rvert_{\\omega_0 = \\pi} = e^{j\\pi n} = (-1)^n\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nn = np.linspace(-5, 5, 11);\nx = np.power(-1, n)\n\nf = plt.figure()\n\nplt.stem(n, x)\nplt.xlabel('$n$')\nplt.ylabel('$x[n]$')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.autoscale(enable=True, axis='x', tight=True)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Properties of DT complex sinusoid\nIf we consider two frequencies: \\(\\omega_0\\) and \\(\\omega_0+2\\pi\\). In the first case: \\[x[n] = e^{j\\omega_0 n}\\] In the second case: \\[\\begin{array}{ll}\nx[n] &= e^{j(\\omega_0+2\\pi) n} \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{e^{j2\\pi n}}_{\\text{always 1}}\\; e^{j\\omega_0 n} \\\\\n&= e^{j\\omega_0 n}\n\\end{array}\\]\nThus the two are the same signal. This has important implications later in the course.\nAnother difference between CT and DT complex sinusoids is periodicity. Recall for a DT signal to be periodic with period \\(N\\) \\[x[n] = x[n+N] \\; \\forall n\\] Substituting the complex sinusoid \\[e^{j\\omega_0 n} = e^{j\\omega_0 (n+N)} = e^{j\\omega_0 n}e^{j\\omega_0 N}\\] requires \\(e^{j\\omega_0 N} = 1\\), which implies \\(\\omega_0 N\\) is a multiple of \\(2\\pi\\): \\[\\omega_0 N = 2\\pi m \\;\\;\\; m = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\cdots\\] or equivalently \\[\\frac{|\\omega_0|}{2\\pi} = \\frac{m}{N}\\] thus \\(\\omega_0\\) must be a rational multiple of \\(\\pi\\).\nTwo DT complex sinusoids are harmonics of one another is both are periodic in \\(N\\), i.e when\n\\[x_k(t) = e^{jk\\frac{2\\pi}{N} n} \\; \\text{for} \\; k = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\cdots\\]\nThis implies there are only \\(N\\) distinct harmonics in DT.\n\n\n3.5.5 DT Complex Exponential: general case\nIn the general case we get a sinusoid signal modulated by an exponential. Let \\(C = Ae^{j\\phi}\\) and \\(\\beta = r + j\\omega_0\\), then \\[x[n] = C e^{\\beta n} =  Ae^{j\\phi} e^{(r+j\\omega_0)n}\\] Expanding the terms and using Euler’s identity gives:\n\\[x[n] = \\underbrace{Ae^{rn}\\cos(\\omega_0 n+\\phi)}_{\\Re \\text{part}} + j \\underbrace{Ae^{rn}\\sin(\\omega_0 n+\\phi)}_{\\Im \\text{part}}\\] Each part is a real sinusoid whose amplitude is modulated by a real exponential.\nThe visualization of the general case is to view the signal \\(x[n]\\) as a vector rotating through fixed angles in the complex plane.\n\n\n\nThe DT complex sinusoid at a specific point in time.",
