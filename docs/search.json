Feel free to share these with your class but you are under no obligation to do so. There are many alternative ways to motivate and develop this material and you should use the way that you like best. This is just how I do it.\nEach chapter corresponds to a “Topic Learning Objective” and would typically be covered in one class meeting on a Tuesday-Thursday or Monday-Wednesday schedule. Note CT and DT topics are taught interleaved rather than in separate blocks. This gets the student used to going back and forth between the two signal and system types. We introduce time-domain topics first, followed by (real) frequency domain topics, using complex frequency domain for sinusoidal analysis only and as a bridge. Detailed analysis and application of Laplace and Z-transforms is left to ECE 3704.",

    "text": "2.1 Signals as Functions\nA continuous-time (CT) signal is a function of one or more independent variables conveying information about a physical phenomena. This lecture gives an introduction to continuous-time signals as functions. You learn how to characterize such signals in a number of ways and are introduced to two very important signals: the unit impulse and the complex exponential.\nIn order to reason about signals mathematically we need a representation or model. Signals are modeled as functions, mappings between sets \\[\nf: A \\rightarrow B\n\\] where \\(A\\) is a set called the domain and \\(B\\) is a set called the range.\nThe most basic classification of signals depends on the sets that makeup the domain and co-domain. We will be interested in two versions of the domain, the reals denoted \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the integers denoted \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). We will be interested in two versions of the co-domain, the reals \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the set of complex numbers \\(\\mathbb{C}\\).\nSome other possibilities:\nThe co-domain can also be complex.\nSince the domains \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) are usually interpreted as time, we will call these time-domain signals. In the time-domain, when the co-domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) we call these real signals. All physical signals are real. However complex signals will become important when we discuss the frequency domain.",

    "text": "2.5 Unit Impulse Function\nAn important CT signal is the unit impulse function, also called the “delta” \\(\\delta\\) function for the symbol traditionally used to define it. Applying this signal to a system models a “kick” to that system. For example, consider striking a tuning fork. The reason this signal is so important is that it will turn out that the response of the system to this input tells us all we need to know about a linear, time-invariant system!\n\n\nExample\n\n\nCT Impulse Function. The CT impulse function is not really a function at all, but a mathematical object called a “distribution”. Some equivalent definitions:\n\\[\n\\delta(t) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0}\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n  \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon} & |t| &lt; \\epsilon\\\\\n  0 & \\text{else}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\n\\[\n\\delta(t) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\epsilon} e^{-\\frac{t^2}{2\\epsilon^2}}\n\\] Note the area under each definition is always one.\n\n\nIn practice we can often use the following definition and some properties, without worrying about the distribution functions. \\[\n\\delta(t) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n  0 & t \\neq 0\\\\\n  \\infty & t = 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\] which we draw as a vertical arrow in plots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Plot of the CT delta function.\n\n\n\nNote the height of the arrow is arbitrary. Often in the case of a non-unit impulse function the area is written in parenthesis near the arrow tip.\nThe following properties of the impulse function will be used often.\n\nThe area under the unit impulse is unity since by definition \\[\n\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t) \\; dt = 1\n\\]\nSampling property: \\(x(t)\\delta(t-t_0) = x(t_0)\\delta(t-t_0)\\)\nSifting Property: \\[\n\\int\\limits_{a}^{b} x(t)\\delta(t-t_0) \\; dt = x(t_0)\n\\] for any \\(a &lt; t_0 &lt; b\\).\n\nWe previously defined the unit step function. The impulse can be defined in terms of the step: \\[\n\\delta(t) = \\frac{du}{dt}\n\\] and vice-versa \\[\nu(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} \\delta(\\tau) \\; d\\tau\n\\] using the notion of distributions, e.g.\n\\[\nu(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} \\delta(\\tau) \\; d\\tau = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\epsilon} e^{-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2\\epsilon^2}} \\; d\\tau = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{2}\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nThe step and impulse function are related, but in many cases finding the response of a system to a step input is easier.\nWe can apply additional transformations to the impulse and step functions to get other useful signals, e.g.\n\nramp \\[\nr(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} u(\\tau) \\; d\\tau = tu(t)\n\\]\ncausal pulse of width \\(\\epsilon\\) \\[\np(t) = u(t) - u(t-\\epsilon)\n\\]\nnon-causal pulse of width \\(2\\epsilon\\) \\[\n    p(t) = u(t+\\epsilon) - u(t-\\epsilon)\n\\]",

When \\(a &gt; 0\\) and \\(C &gt; 0\\), \\(x(t) = C e^{a t}\\) looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Plot of the expoential function with real, positive parameter.\n\n\n\nWhen \\(a &lt; 0\\) and \\(C &gt; 0\\), \\(x(t) = C e^{a t}\\) looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Plot of the expoential function with real, negative parameter.\n\n\n\nIf \\(C &lt; 0\\) the signals reflect about the time axis.\nTo get the pure sinusoidal case, let \\(C \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(a\\) be purely imaginary: \\(a = j\\omega_0\\): \\[\nx(t) = Ce^{j\\omega_0 t}\n\\] where \\(\\omega_0\\) is the frequency (in radians/sec). This is called the complex sinusoid.\nBy Euler’s identity: \\[\ne^{j\\omega_0 t} = \\cos(\\omega_0 t) + j\\sin(\\omega_0 t)\n\\] and \\[\n\\Re(x(t)) = \\cos(\\omega_0 t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( e^{j\\omega_0 t} + e^{-j\\omega_0 t} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Im(x(t)) = \\sin(\\omega_0 t) = \\frac{1}{2j}\\left( e^{j\\omega_0 t} - e^{-j\\omega_0 t} \\right)\n\\] are both real sinusoids.\nNote that the sinusoids are periodic. Recall a signal \\(x(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(T\\) if \\[\nx(t) = x(t+T) \\; \\forall t\n\\] In the case of the complex sinusoid \\[\nCe^{j\\omega_0 t} = Ce^{j\\omega_0 (t+T)}= Ce^{j\\omega_0 t}\\underbrace{e^{j\\omega_0 T}}_{\\text{must be 1}}\n\\]\n\nif \\(\\omega_0 = 0\\) this is true for all \\(T\\)\nif \\(\\omega_0 \\neq 0\\), then to be periodic \\(\\omega_0 T = 2\\pi m\\) for \\(m = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\cdots\\). The smallest \\(T\\) for which this is true is the fundamental period \\(T_0\\) \\[\nT_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\omega_0|}\n\\] or equivalently \\(\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_0}\\)\n\nSome useful properties of sinusoids:\n\nIf \\(x(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(T\\) and \\(g\\) is any function then \\(g(x(t))\\) is periodic with period \\(T\\).\nIf \\(x_1(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(T_1\\) and \\(x_2(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(T_2\\), and if there exists positive integers \\(a,b\\) such that \\[\naT_1 = b T_2 = P\n\\] then \\(x_1(t) + x_2(t)\\) and \\(x_1(t)x_2(t)\\) are periodic with period \\(P\\)\n\nThe last property implies that both \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) must both be rational in \\(\\pi\\) or neither should be. For example\n\n\\(x(t) = \\sin(2\\pi t) + \\cos(5\\pi t)\\) is periodic\n\\(x(t) = \\sin(2 t) + \\cos(5 t)\\) is periodic\n\\(x(t) = \\sin(2\\pi t) + \\cos(5 t)\\) is not periodic\n\nWhen the parameter \\(C\\) is complex we get a phase shift. Again let \\(a = j\\omega_0\\). When \\(C\\) is complex we can write it as \\(C = Ae^{j\\phi}\\) where \\(A = |C|\\) and \\(\\phi = \\angle C\\). Then\n\\[\nx(t) = Ae^{j\\phi} e^{j\\omega_0 t} = Ae^{j(\\omega_0 t+\\phi)}\n\\] and \\[\n\\Re(x(t)) = A\\cos(\\omega_0 t+\\phi)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Im(x(t)) = A\\sin(\\omega_0 t+\\phi)\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sin\\) is a special case of \\(\\cos\\), i.e. \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\), the general real sinusoid is\n\\[\nA\\cos(\\omega_0 t + \\phi)\n\\]\n\n\\(A\\) is called the amplitude\n\\(\\omega_0\\) is again the frequency in radians/sec.\n\\(\\phi\\) is called the phase shift and is related to a time shift \\(T_s\\) by \\[\n\\phi = \\omega_0T_s\n\\]\n\nFor example the signal graphically represented as follows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Example plot of sinusoidal signal.\n\n\n\n\n\nhas the functional representation\n\\[\nx(t) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} (t+\\tfrac{1}{2}) \\right) =  2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} t +\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)\n\\]\n\n2.6.1 Energy of CT complex sinusoid\nRecall the energy of a CT signal \\(x(t)\\) is\n\\[\n  E_x = \\lim_{T\\rightarrow\\infty} \\int\\limits_{-T}^T \\lvert x(t) \\rvert^2 dt \\; .\n\\] Substituting \\(x(t) = e^{j\\omega_0 t}\\) and letting \\(T = N T_0\\) \\[\n    E_x = \\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty} \\int\\limits_{-N T_0}^{N T_0} \\underbrace{\\lvert e^{j\\omega_0 t} \\rvert^2}_{\\text{always 1}} \\; dt = \\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty} 2NT_0 = \\infty\n\\]\n\n\n2.6.2 Power of CT complex sinusoid\nRecall the power of a CT signal \\(x(t)\\) is \\[\n  P_x = \\lim_{T\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{2T} \\int\\limits_{-T}^T \\lvert x(t) \\rvert^2 dt \\; .\n\\] Again, substituting \\(x(t) = e^{j\\omega_0 t}\\) and letting \\(T = N T_0\\) \\[\n  P_x = \\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{2NT_0} \\int\\limits_{-N T_0}^{N T_0} \\underbrace{\\lvert e^{j\\omega_0 t} \\rvert^2}_{\\text{always 1}} \\; dt = \\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{1}{2NT_0} 2NT_0 = 1\n\\]\n\n\n2.6.3 Harmonics\nTwo CT complex sinusoids are harmonics of one another is both are periodic in \\(T_0\\). This occurs when\n\\[\n    x_k(t) = e^{jk\\omega_0 t} \\; \\text{for} \\; k = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\cdots\n\\]\nThe term comes from music where the vibrations of a string instrument are modeled as a weighted combination of harmonic tones.\n\n\n2.6.4 Geometric interpretation of the Complex Exponential\nIn the general case we get a sinusoid signal modulated by an exponential. Let \\(C = Ae^{j\\phi}\\) and \\(a = r + j\\omega_0\\), then \\[\n  x(t) = C e^{a t} =  Ae^{j\\phi} e^{(r+j\\omega_0)t}\n\\] Expanding the terms and using Euler’s identity gives: \\[\nx(t) = \\underbrace{Ae^{rt}\\cos(\\omega_0 t+\\phi)}_{\\Re \\text{part}} + j \\underbrace{Ae^{rt}\\sin(\\omega_0 t+\\phi)}_{\\Im \\text{part}}\n\\] Each part is a real sinusoid whose amplitude is modulated by a real exponential.\nAn important visualization of the general case is to view the signal \\(x(t)\\) as a vector rotating counter-clockwise in the complex plane for positive \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: The CT complex sinusoid at a specific point in time.\n\n\n\nFor \\(r &lt; 0\\) the tip of the arrow traces out an inward spiral, whereas for \\(r &gt; 0\\) it traces out an outward spiral.

    "text": "3.1 Primitive Models\nRecall from the previous chapter that a discrete-time (DT) signal is modeled as a function \\(f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}\\).

These are graphically plotted as stem or “lollipop” plots, as demonstrated in Chapter 2.\nSince the domain \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is usually interpreted as a time index, we will still call these time-domain signals. In the time-domain, when the co-domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) we call these real DT signals. Unlike with CT signals there are no physical limitations requiring DT signals to be real, since in discrete hardware, a value at a given index can be a complex number, i.e. just a pair of numbers. However it is computationally advantageous to restrict ourselves to real arithmetic and such signals are often converted to or from CT signals, which do have to be real. For this reason, real DT signals dominate in models.\nAs with CT signals, we mathematically model DT signals by combining elementary/primitive functions, for example:",

The general DT complex exponential is given by the expression: \\[x[n] = Ce^{\\beta n}\\] where in general \\(C \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) and \\(\\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}\\).

    "text": "4.1 Solving Linear, Constant Coefficient Differential Equations\nRecall a system is a transformation of signals, turning the input signal into the output signal. While this might seem like a new concept to you, you already know something about them from your differential equations course, i.e. MATH 2214 and your circuits course.\nFor example, consider the following circuit:\nwhere the switch moves position at \\(t = 0\\). The governing equation for the circuit when \\(t &lt; 0\\) is \\[\\frac{dV_c}{dt}(t) + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c(t) = 0\\] a homogeneous differential equation of first-order. From a DC analysis, the initial condition on the capacitor voltage is \\(V_C(0^-) = 0\\), so there is no current flowing prior to \\(t = 0\\) and the solution is \\(V_C(t) = 0\\) for \\(t &lt; 0\\).\nAfter the switch is thrown, the governing equation for the circuit when \\(t \\geq 0\\) is \\[\\frac{dV_c}{dt}(t) + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}\\] Since the voltage across the capacitor cannot change instantaneously \\(V_C(0^-) = V_C(0^+) = 0\\), giving the auxillary condition necessary to solve this equation, which has the form \\[V_C(t) = A + Be^{-\\frac{1}{RC}t}\\] Using the auxillary condition we find \\[V_C(0) = A + Be^{-\\frac{1}{RC}0} = A + B = 0 \\mbox{ which implies } B = -A\\] Subsitution back into the differential equation and equating the coefficients gives \\(A = 1\\). Thus the voltage for \\(t \\geq 0\\) is \\[V_C(t) = 1 - e^{-\\frac{1}{RC}t}\\]\nSuppose we consider the voltage after the switch as the input signal \\(x(t)\\) to the system composed of the series RC. As we have seen previously a mathematical model of the switch is the unit step \\(x(t) = u(t)\\). Suppose we consider the capacitor voltage at the output of the system, so that \\(y(t) = V_C(t)\\). Then we can consider the system to be represented by the linear, constant-coefficient differential equation \\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(t) + \\frac{1}{RC}y(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}x(t)\\] where \\(x(t) = u(t)\\) and the solution \\(y(t)\\) is the step response \\[y(t) = \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{1}{RC}t}\\right)u(t)\\]\nAs we will see later this representation of systems is central to the course, so we take some time here to review the solution of such equations.\nA linear, constant coefficient (LCC) differential equation is of the form \\[a_0\\, y + a_1\\, \\frac{dy}{dt} + a_2\\, \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \\cdots + a_N\\, \\frac{d^Ny}{dt^N}  = b_0\\, x + b_1\\, \\frac{dx}{dt} + b_2\\, \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\cdots + b_M\\, \\frac{d^Mx}{dt^M}\\] which can be written compactly as \\[\\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^{N} a_k\\, \\frac{d^ky}{dt^k} = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^{M} b_k\\, \\frac{d^kx}{dt^k}\\]\nIt is helpful to clean up this notation using the derivative operator \\(D^n = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}\\). For example \\(D^2y = \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}\\) and \\(D^0 y= y\\). To give for form as \\[\\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^{N} a_k\\, D^k y = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^{M} b_k\\, D^k x\\]\nWe can factor out the derivative operators \\[a_0y + a_1Dy + a_2D^2y + \\cdots + a_ND^Ny  = b_0\\, x + b_1\\, Dx + b_2\\, D^2x + \\cdots + b_M\\, D^M x\\] \\[\\underbrace{\\left(a_0 + a_1D + a_2D^2 + \\cdots + a_ND^N\\right)}_{\\text{Polynomial in } D, Q(D)} y = \\underbrace{\\left(b_0 + b_1 D + b_2 D^2 + \\cdots + b_M D^M\\right)}_{\\text{Polynomial in } D, P(D)} x\\] to give:\n\\[Q(D)y = P(D)x\\] You learned how to solve these in differential equations (Math 2214) as \\[y(t) = y_\\text{h}(t) + y_\\text{p}(t)\\]\nThe term \\(y_\\text{h}(t)\\) is the solution of the homogeneous equation \\[Q(D)y = 0\\] Given the \\(N-1\\) auxillary conditions \\(y(t_0) = y_0\\), \\(Dy(t_0) = y_1\\), \\(D^2y(t_0) = y_2\\), up to \\(D^{N-1}y(t_0) = y_{N-1}\\).\nThe term \\(y_\\text{p}(t)\\) is the solution of the particular equation \\[Q(D)y = P(D)x\\] for a given \\(x(t)\\).\nRather than recapitulate the solution to \\(y_\\text{h}(t)\\) and \\(y_\\text{p}(t)\\) in the general case we focus on the homogeneous solution \\(y_\\text{h}(t)\\) only. The reason is that we will use the homogeneous solution to find the impulse response below and take a different approach to solving the general case for an arbitrary input using the impulse response and convolution (next week).\nTo solve the homogenous system:\nStep 1: Find the characteristic equation by replacing the derivative operators by powers of an arbitrary complex variable \\(s\\). \\[Q(D) = a_0 + a_1D + a_2D^2 + \\cdots + a_ND^N\\] becomes \\[Q(s) = a_0 + a_1s + a_2s^2 + \\cdots + a_Ns^N\\] a polynomial in \\(s\\) with \\(N\\) roots \\(s_i\\) for \\(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N\\) such that \\[(s - s_1)(s-s_2)\\cdots(s-s_N) = 0\\]\nStep 2: Select the form of the solution, a sum of terms corresponding to the roots of the characteristic equation.\nStep 3: Solve for the unknown constants in the solution using the auxillary conditions.\nWe now examine two common special cases, when \\(N=1\\) (first-order) and when \\(N=2\\) (second-order).",

    "text": "5.1 Definition of linear constant coefficient difference equation\nA difference equation is a relation among combinations of two DT functions and shifted versions of them. Similar to differential equations where the solution is a CT function, the solution to a difference equation is a DT function. For example: \\[y[n+1] + \\frac{1}{2}y[n] = x[n]\\] is a first order, linear, constant-coefficient difference equation. Given \\(x[n]\\) the solution is a function \\(y[n]\\). We can view this as a representation of a DT system, where \\(x[n]\\) is the input signal and \\(y[n]\\) is the output.\nThere is a parallel theory to differential equations for solving difference equations. However in this lecture we will focus specifically on the iterative solution of linear, constant-coefficient difference equations and the case when the input is a delta function, as this is all we need for this course.\nA linear, constant-coefficient, difference equation (LCCDE) comes in one of two forms.\nThe order of the system is given by \\(N\\). The delay and advance forms are equivalent because the equation holds for any \\(n\\), and we can move back and forth between them as needed by a constant index-shift.\nIt will be convenient to define the operator \\(E^m\\) as shifting a DT function by positive \\(m\\), i.e. \\(E^m x[n] = x[n+m]\\), and the operator \\(D^m\\) as shifting a DT function by negative \\(m\\), i.e. \\(D^m x[n] = x[n-m]\\). These are called the advance and delay operators respectively. Then, the advance form of the difference equation using this operator notation is \\[a_0y[n+N] + a_1y[n+N-1] + \\cdots a_N y[n] = b_0 x[n+N] + \\cdots b_Mx[n+N-M]\\] \\[a_0 E^Ny + a_1E^{N-1}y + \\cdots a_N y = b_0 E^{N}x + \\cdots b_M E^{N-M}x\\] Factoring out the advance operators gives \\[\\underbrace{\\left(a_0E^N + a_1E^{N-1} + \\cdots a_N\\right)}_{Q(E)} y = \\underbrace{\\left(b_0 E^{N} + \\cdots b_M E^{N-M}\\right)}_{P(E)} x\\] or \\[Q(E)y[n] = P(E)x[n]\\]\nSimilarly, the delay form of the difference equation using this operator notation is \\[a_0y[n] + a_1y[n-1] + \\cdots a_N y[n-N] = b_0 x[n] + \\cdots b_Mx[n-M]\\] \\[a_0y[n] + a_1 Dy + \\cdots a_N D^N y = b_0 x + \\cdots b_MD^M x\\] Note: The DT delay operator \\(D\\) is similar, but not identical to the derivative operator \\(D\\) in CT.",

    "text": "6.3 System properties and classification\nChoosing the right kind of system model is important. Here are some important properties that allow us to broadly classify systems.\n\nMemory\nInvertability\nCausality\nStability\nTime-invariance\nLinearity\n\nLet’s define each it turn.\n\n6.3.1 Memory\nThe output of a system with memory depends on previous or future inputs and is said to be dynamic. Otherwise the system is memoryless or instantaneous, and the output \\(y(t)\\) at time \\(t\\) depends only on \\(x(t)\\). For example in CT: \\[y(t) = 2x(t)\\] is a memoryless system, while \\[y(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{t} x(\\tau) \\; dt\\] has memory.\n\n\n6.3.2 Invertability\nA system is invertable if there exists a system that when placed in series with the original recovers the input. \\[x(t) \\mapsto{T} y(t) \\mapsto{T^{-1}} x(t)\\] where \\(T^{-1}\\) is the inverse system of \\(T\\). For example, consider a system \\[x(t) \\mapsto y(t) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^t x(\\tau) \\; d\\tau\\] and a system \\[y(t) \\mapsto z(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt}\\] The combination in series \\(x(t) \\mapsto y(t) \\mapsto z(t) = x(t)\\), i.e. the derivative undoes the integral.\n\n\n6.3.3 Causality\nA CT system is causal if the output at time \\(t\\) depends on the input for time values at or before \\(t\\): \\[y(t) \\;\\text{depends on}\\; x(\\tau) \\;\\text{for} \\; \\tau \\leq t\\] All physical CT systems are causal, even if all continuous systems are not (e.g. continuous 2D images \\(f(u,v)\\), have no \"before\" and \"after\").\nFor example, consider a CT system whose impulse response is \\(h(t) = e^{-t^2}\\). This implies the system produces output before (i.e. for \\(t &lt; 0\\)) the impulse is applied at \\(t=0\\), somehow anticipating the arrival of the impulse. Barring time-travel, this is physically impossible.\n\n\n6.3.4 Stability\nA CT system is (BIBO) stable if applying a bounded-input (BI) \\[\\left|x(t)\\right| &lt; \\infty \\; \\forall \\; t\\] results in a bounded-output (BO) \\(x(t) \\mapsto y(t)\\) and \\[\\left|y(t)\\right| &lt; \\infty \\; \\forall \\; t\\] Note, bounded in practice is limited by the physical situation, e.g. positive and negative rails in a physical circuit.\nFor example, a CT system described by the LCCDE \\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(t) - 2y(t) = x(t)\\] is unstable because the solution \\(y(t)\\) will have one term of the form \\(Ce^{2t}\\), for most non-zero inputs \\(x(t)\\) or any non-zero initial condition, that grows unbounded as time increases.\n\n\n6.3.5 Time-invariance\nA CT system is time-invariant if, given \\[x(t) \\mapsto y(t)\\] then a time-shift of the input leads to the same time-shift in the output \\[x(t-\\tau) \\mapsto y(t-\\tau)\\]\nAn important counterexample is a CT system described by a LCCDE, e.g. \\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(t) + y(t) = x(t)\\] but non-zero auxillary conditions at some \\(t_0\\), \\(y(t_0) = y_0 \\neq 0\\). Such systems will have a term in its solution that depends on \\(y_0\\). However if I time shift the input, the term that depends on \\(y_0\\) does not shift (since it is anchored to \\(t_0\\)) and the total output does not shift identically with the input. Thus the system cannot be time-invariant.\n\n\n6.3.6 Linearity\nA CT system is linear if the output due to a sum of scaled individual inputs is the same as the scaled sum of the individual outputs with respect to those inputs. In other words given \\[x_1(t) \\mapsto y_1(t) \\;\\text{and}\\; x_2(t) \\mapsto y_2(t)\\] then \\[a x_1(t) + b x_2(t) \\mapsto a y_1(t) + b y_2(t)\\] for constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Note this property extends to sums of arbitrary signals, e.g. if \\[x_i(t) \\mapsto y_i(t) \\; \\forall\\; i \\in [1 \\cdots N]\\] then given \\(N\\) constants \\(a_i\\), if the system is linear \\[\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^N a_i x_i(t) \\mapsto \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^N a_i y_i(t)\\] This is a very important property, called superposition, and it simplifies the analysis of systems greatly.\nSimilar to time-invariance an important non-linear system is that is described by a LCCDE with non-zero auxillary conditions at some \\(t_0\\), \\(y(t_0) = y_0\\). Again such systems will have a term in it’s solution that depends on \\(y_0\\). Given two inputs, each individual response will have that term in it, so thier sum has double that term. However the response due to the sum of the inputs would again only have one and the sum of the responses would not be the same as the response of the sum. Such a system cannot be linear.",

Here are some important properties that allow us to broadly classify systems.\n\nMemory\nInvertability\nCausality\nStability\nTime-invariance\nLinearity\n\nLet’s define each it turn.\n\n7.2.1 Memory\nThe output of a DT system with memory depends on previous or future inputs and is said to be dynamic. Otherwise the system is memoryless or instantaneous, and the output \\(y[n]\\) at index \\(n\\) depends only on \\(x[n]\\). For example: \\[y[n] = 2x[n]\\] is a memoryless system, while \\[y[n+1] + y[n] = x[n]\\] has memory. To see this, write the difference equation in recursive form \\[y[n] = -y[n-1] + x[n-1]\\] and we see explicitly the current output \\(y[n]\\) depends on past values of output and input.\n\n\n7.2.2 Invertability\nA system is invertible if there exists a system that when placed in series with the original recovers the input. \\[x[n] \\mapsto{T} y[n] \\mapsto{T^{-1}} x[n]\\] where \\(T^{-1}\\) is the inverse system of \\(T\\). For example, consider a system \\[x[n] \\mapsto y[n] = \\sum\\limits_{m=-\\infty}^{n} x[m]\\] and a system \\[y[n] \\mapsto z[n] = y[n] - y[n-1]\\] The combination in series \\(x[n] \\mapsto y[n] \\mapsto z[n] = x[n]\\), since \\[z[n] = y[n] - y[n-1] = \\sum\\limits_{m=-\\infty}^{n} x[m] - \\sum\\limits_{m=-\\infty}^{n-1} x[m] = x[n]\\] i.e. the difference undoes the accumulation.\n\n\n7.2.3 Causality\nA DT system is causal if the output at index \\(n\\) depends on the input for index values at or before \\(n\\): \\[y[n] \\;\\text{depends on}\\; x[m] \\;\\text{for} \\; m \\leq n\\] While all physical CT systems are causal, practical DT systems may not be since we can use memory to \"shift time\". For CT systems we cannot store the infinite number of values between two time points \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\), but we can store the \\(n_2-n_1\\) values of a DT system between between two indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) (assuming infinite precision).\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider a DT system whose difference equation is \\[y[n] = -x[n-1] + 2x[n] - x[n+1]\\] We see the current output \\(y[n]\\) depends on a \"future\" value of the input \\(x[n+1]\\). Thus the system is not causal. In practice we can shift the difference equation to \\[y[n-1] = -x[n-2] + 2x[n-1] - x[n]\\] and then delay the output by one sample to get \\(y[n]\\).\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider a DT system whose difference equation is \\[y[n] = -y[n-1] + 2x[n]\\] We see the current output \\(y[n]\\) depends on a \"past\" value of the output \\(y[n-1]\\) and the current input \\(x[n]\\). Thus the system is causal. In practice we can immediately compute \\(y[n]\\) with no delay.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Stability\nA DT system is (BIBO) stable if applying a bounded-input (BI) \\[\\left|x[n]\\right| &lt; \\infty \\; \\forall \\; n\\] results in a bounded-output (BO) \\(x[n] \\mapsto y[n]\\) and \\[\\left|y[n]\\right| &lt; \\infty \\; \\forall \\; n\\] Note, bounded in practice is limited by the physical situation, e.g. the number of bits used to store values.\nFor example, a DT system described by the LCCDE \\[y[n+1] - 2 y[n] = x[n+1]\\] is unstable because the solution \\(y[n]\\) will have one term of the form \\(\\left( 2\\right)^n\\), for most non-zero inputs \\(x[n]\\) or any non-zero initial condition, that grows unbounded as \\(n\\) increases.\n\n\n7.2.5 Time-invariance\nA DT system is time(index)-invariant if, given \\[x[n] \\mapsto y[n]\\] then an index-shift of the input leads to the same index-shift in the output \\[x[n-m] \\mapsto y[n-m]\\]\nAn important example is a DT system described by a LCCDE, e.g. \\[y[n+1] - \\frac{1}{2} y[n] = x[n+1]\\] or in recursive form \\[y[n] = \\frac{1}{2} y[n-1] + x[n]\\]\nIf we index shift the input \\(x[n - m]\\) we replace \\(n\\) by \\(n-m\\) and the difference equation becomes \\[y[n-m+1] - \\frac{1}{2} y[n-m] = x[n-m+1]\\] which has the same solution shifted by \\(m\\) \\[y[n-m] = \\frac{1}{2} y[n-m -1] + x[n-m]\\]\nIf a coefficient depends on \\(n\\) however, e.g \\[y[n+1] - \\frac{n}{2} y[n] = x[n+1]\\] so that it is no longer LCC then the solution depends on \\(m\\) and the system is no longer time-invariant.\n\n\n7.2.6 Linearity\nA DT system is linear if the output due to a sum of scaled individual inputs is the same as the scaled sum of the individual outputs with respect to those inputs. In other words given \\[x_1[n] \\mapsto y_1[n] \\;\\text{and}\\; x_2[n] \\mapsto y_2[n]\\] then \\[a x_1[n] + b x_2[n] \\mapsto a y_1[n] + b y_2[n]\\] for constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Note this property extends to sums of arbitrary signals, e.g. if \\[x_i[n] \\mapsto y_i[n] \\; \\forall\\; i \\in [1 \\cdots N]\\] then given \\(N\\) constants \\(a_i\\), if the system is linear \\[\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^N a_i x_i[n] \\mapsto \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^N a_i y_i[n]\\] This is a very important property, called superposition, and it simplifies the analysis of systems greatly.\nAn important non-linear system is that is described by a LCCDE with non-zero auxiliary conditions at some \\(n_0\\), \\(y[n_0] = y_0\\). As in CT, such systems will have a term in it’s solution that depends on \\(y_0\\). Given two inputs, each individual response will have that term in it, so their sum has double that term. However the response due to the sum of the inputs would again only have one and the sum of the responses would not be the same as the response of the sum. Such a system cannot be linear. Thus the system must be \"at rest\" before applying the input in order to be a linear system.",

    "text": "11.2 Connections to Convolution\nEach subsystem, \\(\\mathcal{S}_i\\), can be represented by a basic discrete time-domain operation (e.g. differences, running sums, addition, and scaling) or more generally by its impulse response \\(h_i[n]\\).\nFor example a block representing an system acting as a delay of one sample is typically drawn as\n\n\n\nA block represeting a delay.\n\n\nThis is equivalent to an impulse response \\(h[n] = \\delta[n-1]\\) so that it might also be drawn as\n\n\n\nA block represeting a delay as an impulse response.\n\n\nSimilarly, a block representing an system acting as an advance of one sample is typically drawn as\n\n\n\nA block represeting an advance.\n\n\nThis is equivalent to an impulse response \\(h[n] = \\delta[n+1]\\) so that it might also be drawn as\n\n\n\nA block represeting an advance as an impulse response.\n\n\nWe can use the concept of convolution to connect block diagrams to the properties of convolution\n\nA single block is equivalent to convolution with the impulse response for that subsystem\n\n\n\nA block represeted by an arbitrary impulse response.\n\n\nUsing the associative property, a series connection of two blocks becomes\n\n\n\nA series connection of blocks and the overall impulse response.\n\n\nwhich can be reduced to a single convolution \\(y[n] = h_3[n]*x[n]\\) where \\(h_3[n] = h_1[n]*h_2[n]\\).\nUsing the distributive property, a parallel connection of two blocks becomes\n\n\n\nA parallel connection of blocks and the overall impulse response.\n\n\nwhich is equivalent to a single convolution \\(y[n] = h_3[n]*x[n]\\) where \\(h_3[n] = h_1[n] + h_2[n]\\).\nIn the feedback connection let \\(w[n]\\) be the output of the summation\n\n\n\nA feedback connection of blocks and the overall impulse response.\n\n\nThen \\(y[n] = h_1[n]*w[n]\\) and \\(w[n] = x[n] - h_2[n]*y[n]\\). Substituting the later into the former gives \\(y[n] = h_1*(x-h_2[n]*y[n])\\). Using the distributive property we get \\(y[n] = h_1[n]*x[n] - h_1[n]*h_2[n]*y[n]\\). Isolating the input on the right-hand side and using \\(y[n] = \\delta[n]*y[n]\\) we get \\[y[n] + h_1[n]*h_2[n]*y[n] = \\left(\\delta[n] + h_1[n]*h_2[n]\\right)*y[n] = h_1[n]*x[n]\\] We can solve this for \\(y[n]\\) using the concept of inverse systems. Let \\(h_3[n]* \\left(\\delta[n] + h_1[n]*h_2[n]\\right)= \\delta[n]\\), i.e. \\(h_3\\) is the inverse system of \\(\\delta[n] + h_1[n]*h_2[n]\\). Then \\[y[n] = h_3[n]*h_1[n]*x[n]\\]\n\nRecall, when the system is instantaneous (memoryless) the impulse response is \\(a\\delta[n]\\) for some constant \\(a\\). This is the same as scaling the signal by \\(a\\). We typically drop the block in such cases and draw the input-output operation as\n\n\n\nA multiplier/amplifier connection between blocks and the overall impulse response.\n\n\nThese properties allow us to perform transformations, either breaking up a system into subsystems, or reducing a system to a single block.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider a second-order system system with impulse response \\[h[n] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\\, u[n] + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n\\, u[n]\\] We can express this as a block diagram consisting of two parallel blocks\n\n\n\nBlock diagram corersponding to the example, using a parallel realization.",

If we can decompose an input into a (possibly infinite) sum of such signals, we can easily determine the output using the superposition principle. In this section we consider the decomposition when the input is periodic, called the CT Fourier Series (CTFS).\nRecall a signal \\(x(t)\\) is periodic, with fundamental frequency \\(\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_0}\\) rad/sec or \\(f_0 = \\frac{1}{T_0}\\) Hertz, if \\(x(t) = x(t+kT_0)\\) for integer multiple \\(k\\) and fundamental period \\(T_0\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). As we shall see, in this case the complex exponent of the Eigenfunction becomes \\(s_k = jk\\omega_0\\), and the decomposition is a countably infinite sum. This gives the input-output relationship for a stable LTI system as \\[x(t) = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t} \\; \\longrightarrow\\; y(t) = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} H(j k\\omega_0)\\, a_k \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}\\] where \\(H(j k\\omega_0)\\) are the Eigenvalues or frequency response. We now turn to determining under what circumstances the decomposition exists and how to find the coefficients \\(a_k\\).\nSuppose we can approximate (we will revisit shortly when this approximation is exact) the periodic function \\(x(t)\\) by the sum \\[\\boxed{x(t) \\approx \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}\\;.}\\] This is called the synthesis equation of the CT Fourier series.\nAssuming equivalence, let us multiply both sides by the function \\(e^{-jn\\omega_0 t}\\), \\[x(t)e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}e^{-jn\\omega_0 t}\\] and integrate over one period \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} x(t)e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt\\] Exchanging the order of integration and summation in the right-hand expression gives \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} x(t)e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k \\left[ \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt\\right]\\] The bracketed term can be rewritten as \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\, e^{j (k-n)\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\cos((k-n)\\omega_0 t) \\; dt + j \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\sin((k-n)\\omega_0 t) \\; dt\\] We now note that for \\(k\\neq n\\) the integrals of the real and imaginary parts are zero \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\cos((k-n)\\omega_0 t) \\; dt = \\frac{1}{(k-n)\\omega_0}\\sin((k-n)\\omega_0 t) \\Big|_{0}^{T_0} = \\frac{1}{(k-n)\\omega_0}\\sin((k-n)2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{(k-n)\\omega_0}\\sin(0) = 0\\] \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\sin((k-n)\\omega_0 t) \\; dt = -\\frac{1}{(k-n)\\omega_0}\\cos((k-n)\\omega_0 t) \\Big|_{0}^{T_0} = -\\frac{1}{(k-n)\\omega_0}\\cos((k-n)2\\pi) + \\frac{1}{(k-n)\\omega_0}\\cos(0) = 0\\] When \\(k=n\\) \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} e^{j (k-n)\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\; dt = T_0\\] Thus the bracketed term above is \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = T_0\\, \\delta[k-n]\\] and the right-hand side is \\[\\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k \\left[ \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} \\, e^{j k\\omega_0 t}e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt\\right] = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k  T_0\\, \\delta[k-n] = T_0 \\,a_n\\] Thus we obtain the analysis equation of the CT Fourier series: \\[\\boxed{a_n = \\frac{1}{T_0} \\int\\limits_{0}^{T_0} x(t)e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt}\\] where the integration can be over any interval of length \\(T_0\\) that is equal to the period, and the symbol for the subscript (integer \\(n\\)) is arbitrary. The CT Fourier Series coefficients are also called the spectrum of the signal. In general the \\(a_k\\) are complex. The function of \\(k\\), \\(|a_k|\\) is called the amplitude spectrum. The function of \\(k\\), \\(\\angle a_k\\) is called the phase spectrum. When plotting the coefficients it is common to plot the amplitude and phase spectrum together.",

    "text": "15.1 Synthesis and Analysis Equation\nRecall the complex exponential \\(z^n\\) is the Eigenfunction of DT LTI systems. If we can decompose an input into a (possibly infinite) sum of such signals, we can easily determine the output using the superposition principle. In this section we consider the decomposition when the input is periodic, called the DT Fourier Series (DTFS). The DTFS is similar, but not identical to the CTFS. Notably, the approximation requires only a finite number of terms, there are no convergence issues, and the resulting spectrum is a periodic function.\nRecall a DT signal \\(x[n]\\) is periodic, with fundamental frequency \\(\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\) rad/sec, if \\(x[n] = x[n+kN]\\) for integer multiple \\(k\\) and fundamental period \\(N \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). As we shall see, in this case the complex base of the Eigenfunction becomes \\(z_k = e^{jk\\omega_0}\\), and the decomposition is a finite sum. This gives the input-output relationship for a stable DT LTI system as \\[x[n] = \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0n} \\;\\longrightarrow\\;  y[n] = \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} H\\left(e^{j k\\omega_0}\\right) a_k e^{jk\\omega_0 n}\\] where \\(H\\left(e^{j k\\omega_0}\\right)\\) are the Eigenvalues or DT frequency response. We now turn to how to find the coefficients \\(a_k\\).\nSimilar to the CTFS we wish to show that any periodic DT signal can be represented by the sum of complex exponentials whose frequencies are harmonics of the fundamental. This differs from the CTFS in that there are only \\(N\\) distinct harmonics, so that the sum is over a finite range \\[\\boxed{x[n] = \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0n} }\\] where \\(N\\) is the period and \\(N_0\\) is any starting index for the sum. Note the course text defines \\(&lt;N&gt; = \\{ N_0, N_0 + 1,  \\cdots (N_0 + N-1) \\}\\). This is called the synthesis equation of the DT Fourier series.\nOne approach to find the coefficients \\(a_k\\) is to note that there are a finite number of terms in the summation and the signal has a finite number of values over one period. This gives a system of \\(N\\) linear equations in \\(N\\) unknowns (the \\(a_k\\)’s) \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  x[N_0] &= \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0N_0}\\\\\n  x[N_0+1] &= \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0(N_0+1)}\\\\\n  \\vdots\\hspace{2em} &= \\hspace{2em}\\vdots\\\\\n  x[N_0+N-1] &= \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0(N_0+N-1)}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\] which can be solved to find the coefficients using linear algebra.\nAnother approach is similar to that taken when deriving the CT Fourier Series. Beginning with the synthesis equation \\[x[n] = \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0n}\\] we multiply both sides by \\(e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi r}{N} n}\\) for \\(r \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) and sum over \\(N\\) terms \\[\\sum\\limits_{n = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} x[n]e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi r}{N} n} = \\sum\\limits_{n = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0n}e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi r}{N} n}\\] We then interchange to order of summation on the right-hand-side \\[\\sum\\limits_{n = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} x[n]e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi r}{N} n} =  \\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k \\underbrace{\\sum\\limits_{n = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} e^{jk\\omega_0n}e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi r}{N} n}}\\] Since \\(\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}\\), the bracketed term is\nand the right-hand side is \\[\\sum\\limits_{k = N_0}^{N_0 + N-1} a_k N \\delta[(k-r) + mN] = Na_r\\] since \\(N_0 &lt; mN &lt; N_0 + 1\\) for some \\(m\\). Solving for \\(a_r\\) gives the analysis equation of the DT Fourier series: \\[\\boxed{a_r = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum\\limits_{n = N_0}^{N_0+N-1} x[n]e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N} r n }}\\] where the summation can be over any interval of length \\(N\\) and the symbol for the subscript (integer \\(r\\)) is arbitrary. The DT Fourier Series coefficients are also called the spectrum of the signal. In general the \\(a_k\\) are complex. Note the spectrum is periodic in \\(N\\). The function of \\(k\\), \\(|a_k|\\) is called the amplitude spectrum. The function of \\(k\\), \\(\\angle a_k\\) is called the phase spectrum. When plotting the coefficients it is common to plot the amplitude and phase spectrum together over a single interval of length \\(N\\) (since it is periodic).",

In this section we consider the decomposition when the input is aperiodic, called the CT Fourier Transform (CTFT).\nIn contrast to the CT Fourier series, in this case the complex exponent of the Eigenfunction becomes \\(s = j\\omega\\) a continuous variable, and the decomposition is an uncountably infinite sum (integral). This gives the input-output relationship for a stable LTI system as \\[x(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(j\\omega) \\, e^{j \\omega t}\\; d\\omega \\;\\longrightarrow\\; y(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(j\\omega) X(j\\omega) \\, e^{j \\omega t}\\; d\\omega\\] where \\(H(j \\omega)\\) are the Eigenvalues, again called the frequency response.

    "text": "16.2 Examples of the CT Fourier Transform\n\n\n16.2.1 Fourier Transform of the impulse.\n\n\nConsider the signal \\(x(t) = \\delta(t)\\).

The Fourier transform is\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n    X(\\omega) &= \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-j\\omega t}\\; dt\\\\\n    &= \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}  e^{at} \\, e^{-j\\omega t}\\; dt\\\\\n    &= \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}  e^{(a-j\\omega) t}\\; dt\\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{a-j\\omega } e^{(a-j\\omega) t} \\Big|_{0}^{\\infty}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{a-j\\omega } \\left[ \\lim_{T\\rightarrow\\infty} e^{(a-j\\omega) T} - \\underbrace{e^{(a-j\\omega) (0)}}_{1}\\right]\n  \n\\end{aligned}\\]\nThis example raises the question, of when does the Fourier Transform exist? Note if \\(a &lt; 0\\) then the limit above converges to zero, otherwise the integral diverges. In the former case we say the Fourier transform exists, and in the latter that it does not. Thus\n\\[X(\\omega) = \\frac{-1}{a-j\\omega } = \\frac{1}{j\\omega-a} \\mbox{ for } a &lt; 0\\;.\\]\nNote when \\(a &lt; 0\\), \\(x(t)\\) is an energy signal. A sufficient, but not necessary condition for the Fourier transform to exist is that the signal be an energy signal.\nFor this example, let’s examine the spectrum, noting \\[|X(\\omega)| = \\frac{1}{(a^2 + \\omega^2)^\\frac{1}{2}} \\hspace{2em}\\mbox{and}\\hspace{2em} \\angle X(\\omega) = -\\arctan\\left( \\frac{\\omega}{-a}\\right)\\] plotted below for \\(a = -1\\).\nTODO\n\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Fourier transform of a complex sinusoid.\n\n\nConsider the signal \\(x(t) = e^{j\\omega_0 t}\\) for \\(\\omega_0\\in \\mathbb{R}\\).

When \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) this integral diverges \\[\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}  e^{-j(\\omega_0-\\omega) t}dt = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}  e^{-j(0) t} dt= \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt = \\infty\\] What signal is zero everywhere, but infinite at one point (I am hand-waving a bit here)? The delta function \\[X(\\omega) = A\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_0) \\mbox{ for some constant } A.\\] To find the constant we can use the inverse transform\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n    x(t) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\omega)e^{j\\omega t}\\; d\\omega\\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}  A\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_0) e^{j\\omega t}\\; d\\omega\\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} A e^{j\\omega_0 t}\\\\\n    &= e^{j\\omega_0 t}\n  \n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhich implies \\(A = 2\\pi\\).\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Fourier transform of a real sinusoid.\n\n\nConsider the signal \\(x(t) = \\cos(\\omega_0 t)\\) for \\(\\omega_0\\in \\mathbb{R}\\).

    "text": "17.1 Analysis and Synthesis Equations\nRecall the complex exponential \\(z^{n}\\) for \\(z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\) is the Eigenfunction of DT LTI systems. If we can decompose an input into a (possibly infinite) sum of such signals, we can easily determine the output using the superposition principle. In this section we consider the decomposition when the input is aperiodic, called the DT Fourier Transform (DTFT).\nIn contrast to the DT Fourier series, in this case the complex exponent of the Eigenfunction becomes \\(z = e^{j\\omega}\\) a continuous variable, and the decomposition is an uncountably infinite sum (integral). This gives the input-output relationship for a stable DT LTI system as \\[x[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\limits_{2\\pi} X\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right) \\, e^{j \\omega n}\\; d\\omega \\;\\longrightarrow\\; y[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int\\limits_{2\\pi} H\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right) X\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right) \\, e^{j \\omega n}\\; d\\omega\\] where \\(H\\left(e^{j \\omega}\\right)\\) are the Eigenvalues, again called the frequency response. We now turn to determining under what circumstances the decomposition exists and how to find the function \\(X\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\).\nNote: The notation \\(X\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\) can be confusing. It just emphasizes that \\(z \\rightarrow e^{j\\omega}\\). The expressions are functions of the independent variable \\(\\omega\\).\nConsider the Fourier series of \\(x[n]\\), a periodically extended finite-length DT signal \\(\\tilde{x}[n]\\), e.g.\nTODO graphics/dt-derivation.pdf\nwhere \\(\\tilde{x}[n]\\) is zero outside the range \\([N_1,N_2]\\).

Substituting back into the synthesis equation \\[\\tilde{x}[n] = \\sum\\limits_{k = -N_1}^{N_2} a_k e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn} = \\sum\\limits_{k = -N_1}^{N_2} \\frac{1}{N} X\\left(e^{jk\\omega_0}\\right) e^{jk\\omega_0 n}\\] Now note that \\(N = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_0}\\) so that \\[\\tilde{x}[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sum\\limits_{k = -N_1}^{N_2} X\\left(e^{jk\\omega_0}\\right) e^{jk\\omega_0 n} \\; \\omega_0\\] Now let \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\).\nThis is shown graphically in the figure below.

In that case, evaluating the Eigenvalues on the imaginary axis \\(s = j\\omega\\) gives the CT frequency response \\(H(j\\omega)\\). This converts from a function of a complex variable, \\(s\\), to one of a real variable \\(\\omega\\).\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider a system with Eigenvalues (transfer function) \\[H(s) = \\frac{2}{s+5}\\mbox{ for } \\Re{s} &gt; -5\\] Determine the frequency response of the system, if possible.\nSolution: We first need to check if the system is stable using the region-of-convergence. Since the real part of the region of convergence includes the imaginary axis (\\(\\Re s = 0\\)), the system is stable. To find the frequency response we substitute \\(s = j\\omega\\) to give \\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{2}{j\\omega+5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider an apparently similar system with Eigenvalues \\[H(s) = \\frac{2}{s-5}\\mbox{ for } \\Re{s} &gt; 5\\] Determine the frequency response of the system, if possible.\nSolution: Again, we first need to check of the system is stable using the region-of-convergence. Since the real part of the region of convergence does not include the imaginary axis (\\(\\Re s = 0\\)), the system is unstable. Thus, the frequency response does not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the CTFT\nAnother way we can view the frequency response is as the CT Fourier Transform of the impulse response. If the system is stable, then the impulse response is absolutely integrable, and the Fourier transform exists giving \\(H(j\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{h(t)\\right\\}\\). This is connected to the transfer function by noting the bilateral Laplace transform and the Fourier Transform are identical under the substitution \\(s = j\\omega\\), which is allowed if the system is stable.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nSuppose the impulse response of a CT LTI system is given by \\[h(t) = \\left(e^{-t}-e^{-6t}\\right)u(t)\\] Determine the frequency response of the system, if possible.\nSolution: If the system is stable, the Fourier transform of the impulse response exists. Since \\[\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} \\left| e^{-t}-e^{-6t} \\right| \\; dt &lt; \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t} \\; dt &lt; \\infty\\] the system is stable and the Fourier Transform exists, giving \\[H(j\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\left(e^{-t}-e^{-6t}\\right)u(t) \\right\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\left(e^{-t}u(t) \\right\\} - \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{e^{-6t}\\right)u(t) \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{j\\omega + 1} - \\frac{1}{j\\omega + 6} = \\frac{7}{6-\\omega^2 + j7\\omega}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly from a LCCDE\nBy the convolution theorem of the CTFT, the frequency response is the ratio of the output to input in the frequency domain, i.e. \\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)}\\] We can easily determine this ratio from the LCCDE representation of the system using the derivative property of the Fourier Transform. Recall this property states if \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} = X(j\\omega)\\) then \\[\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d^n x}{dt^n}(t) \\right\\} = (j\\omega)^n  X(j\\omega) \\; .\\]\nIf the system is stable (and thus the frequency response exists) then all roots of the characteriztic equation \\(Q(D)\\) have real parts that are less than zero. If the system is stable we can take the Fourier transform of each term of the LCCDE using the derivative property, then algebrically solve for the ratio of output to input. Note this provides a signifigant savings in analysis effort since we do not have to first find the impulse response, then take its Fourier transform to arrive at the frequency response (although that approach is still valid).\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider a system decribed by the LCCDE \\[\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}(t) + 15\\frac{dy}{dt}(t) + 50y(t) = 10x(t)\\] Determine the frequency response of the system, if possible.\nSolution: We first need to check for stability. The characteristic equation is \\(Q(D) = D^2 + 15D + 50\\) which has two real roots \\(-10\\) and \\(-5\\). Since both are less than zero, the system is stable. Next we take the Fourier transform of both sides and apply the derivative property \\[(j\\omega)^2Y(j\\omega) + 15(j\\omega) Y(j\\omega) + 50Y(j\\omega) = 10X(j\\omega)\\] and rearrange to get the frequency response \\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)} = \\frac{10}{(j\\omega)^2 + 15(j\\omega) + 50} = \\frac{10}{50-\\omega^2 + j15\\omega}\\]",

Since the magnitude and phase allow us to directly see the system behavior at a given frequency, those plots are much more useful.\nRather than simply plot the magnitude and phase as a function of \\(\\omega\\), it is common to change the abscissa (horizontal / \\(\\omega\\)-axis) to be on a logarithmic scale and so only plot the positive frequency portion of the spectrum (recall if the signal is real, the frequency response is even, so no information is lost). This is because the frequency response for physically realizable systems changes slowly as a function of frequency. Plotting on a log-scale compresses this information horizontally so that we can see how a wide range of frequency content is scaled. When plotting the magnitude spectrum it is also common to make the ordinate (vertical / gain axis) to be in decibels (dB). This is because of Weber’s law, which states the humans perceive a doubling in strength of stimulus, when it is actually a ten-fold increase. Thus the magnitude of the frequency response in dB is \\(20 \\log_{10} |H(j\\omega)|\\). When the frequency response is plotted this particular way we get what is called a Bode plot (after the engineer Hendrik Wade Bode, an important figure in the development of control theory).\nYou will likely encounter Bode plots at several points in your career, so it is important to understand them well enough to create them on your own using software and read them. Also data-sheets and other documentation for CT devices generally use a Bode plot rather than giving an explicit mathematical model of the frequency response. It is also instructive to learn how to plot them manually (which was the traditional way to do it) since it gives you insight that can help with reverse engineering a model, however we do not cover this in detail in this course. Note that we will plot the spectrum as a function of frequency in units of rad/s, but it is also common to see it plotted in units of Hz. Take care to read the horizontal axis label as mixing up the two is a common source of error.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nConsider a frequency response given by \\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{20000}{(j\\omega)^2 + 300(j\\omega) + 20000}\\] The following Matlab code shows you how to plot the spectrum as a Bode plot (with some extra code to make it look nicer). You should read the documentation for the bode command in Matlab. It is also easy to just compute the magnitude and phase yourself.\n    H = tf([20000],[1,300,20000]);\n    [mag,ph,w] = bode(H);\n\n    % Create a nice bode plot \n    hFig = figure();\n    hold on;\n\n    subplot(2,1,1);\n    hm = semilogx(w,20*log10(squeeze(mag)));\n    grid on;\n    hTitle  = title ('Frequency Response');\n    hYLabel1 = ylabel('Magnitude (dB)');\n    set(gca, 'FontSize', 14, 'YTick', -60:10:20, ...\n        'Box', 'off', 'LineWidth', 2);\n\n    subplot(2,1,2);\n    hp = semilogx(w,squeeze(ph*(pi/180)));\n    grid on;\n    hYLabel2 = ylabel('Phase (radians)');\n    hXLabel = xlabel('Frequency (rad/s)');\n    set(gca, 'FontSize', 14, 'Box', 'off', 'LineWidth', 2);\n\n    set(hm, 'linewidth', 2);\n    set(hp, 'linewidth', 2);\n    set([hXLabel, hYLabel1, hYLabel2]  , ...\n         'FontSize'   , 14          );\n    set( hTitle                    , ...\n         'FontSize'   , 14          , ...\n         'FontWeight' , 'bold'      );\nThis gives the following plot\nTODO lecture20_1.png\n\n\nTo read a Bode plot to see the behavior of the system at a given frequency, one need only read the values off the plot and convert from dB to a unit-less gain. A common mistake is to not realize the horizontal axis is logarithmic.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nSuppose you are given the Bode plot (only) from the previous example and are asked what the output of the system is when the input is \\(x(t) = \\cos(2\\pi 32 t)\\), i.e. a sinusoid at 32 Hz.\nSolution: First we determine the frequency in rad/s, \\(\\omega = 2\\pi 32 \\approx 200\\) rad/s. We go to that frequency on the Bode plot and read off a value of about \\(-10\\) dB for the magnitude and about \\(-1.9\\) rad for the phase. To convert back from dB \\[|H(200)| = 10^{\\frac{-10}{20}} \\approx 0.3\\] so the output would be \\[y(t) \\approx 0.3\\cos(2\\pi 32 t - 1.9)\\]",

Given a stable LTI system with frequency response \\(H(j\\omega)\\) \\[x(t) = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k e^{jk\\omega_0 t} \\longrightarrow y(t) = \\sum\\limits_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} a_k H(jk\\omega_0) e^{jk\\omega_0 t}\\]\nNote the output is equivalent to a signal with Fourier series coefficients \\(b_k = a_k H(jk\\omega_0)\\). That is the Fourier coefficients are scaled by the frequency response at the harmonic frequency \\(k\\omega_0\\).\nSimilarly for aperiodic signals, given a stable LTI system with frequency response \\(H(j\\omega)\\) \\[x(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(j\\omega) e^{j\\omega t}\\; d\\omega \\longrightarrow y(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(j\\omega) H(j\\omega) e^{j\\omega t}\\; d\\omega\\]\nNote the output is equivalent to a signal with Fourier Transform \\(Y(j\\omega) = X(j\\omega) H(jk\\omega_0)\\). That is the Fourier transform at each continuous frequency \\(\\omega\\) is scaled by the frequency response at that frequency.\nWe can use this behavior to our advantage. In many applications we want to modify the values of \\(a_k\\) or \\(X(j\\omega)\\) selectively, passing them unmodified, increasing (amplifying) them, or decreasing (attenuating) them. This is accomplished by designing a frequency response. Such systems are called frequency selective filters and come in 4 basic types:\nWhile the design of such filters is outside the scope of this course, you are now equipped to understand and apply them based on your knowledge of the Fourier methods covered over the past several weeks.\nThe above filter types each have an ideal (although unrealizable) form.\nLow-pass filters remove frequency content above a threshold, \\(\\omega_c\\), called the cutoff frequency. They have an ideal frequency response \\[H(j\\omega) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lc}\n  1 & -\\omega_c &lt; \\omega &lt; \\omega_c\\\\\n  0 & \\text{else}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] with magnitude and phase plot\nTODO lowpass-ideal.pdf\nThe range of frequencies below \\(|\\omega_c|\\) are called the pass-band. The range of frequencies above \\(|\\omega_c|\\) are called the stop-band.\nHigh-pass filters remove frequency content below the cutoff frequency \\(\\omega_c\\). They have an ideal frequency response \\[H(j\\omega) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lc}\n  0 & -\\omega_c &lt; \\omega &lt; \\omega_c\\\\\n  1 & \\text{else}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] with magnitude and phase plot\nTODO highpass-ideal.pdf\nThe range of frequencies above \\(|\\omega_c|\\) are called the pass-band. The range of frequencies below \\(|\\omega_c|\\) are called the stop-band.\nBandpass filters remove frequency content outside a band of frequencies called the pass-band. They have an ideal frequency response \\[H(j\\omega) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lc}\n  1 & -\\omega_0 - \\frac{B}{2} &lt; \\omega &lt; -\\omega_0+\\frac{B}{2}\\\\[1em]\n  1 & \\omega_0 -\\frac{B}{2} &lt; \\omega &lt; \\omega_0+\\frac{B}{2}\\\\[1em]\n  0 & \\text{else}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] where \\(\\omega_0\\) is the center frequency and \\(B\\) is the bandwidth. The frequencies outside this range are in the stop-band. The magnitude and phase plot looks like\nTODO bandpass-ideal.pdf\nFinally, notch or bandstop filters remove frequency content inside a band of frequencies (the stop band) defined by the center frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) and bandwidth \\(B\\). The ideal frequency response is \\[H(j\\omega) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lc}\n  0 & -\\omega_0 - \\frac{B}{2} &lt; \\omega &lt; -\\omega_0+\\frac{B}{2}\\\\[1em]\n  0 & \\omega_0 -\\frac{B}{2} &lt; \\omega &lt; \\omega_0+\\frac{B}{2}\\\\[1em]\n  1 & \\text{else}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] with magnitude and phase plot\nTODO bandstop-ideal.pdf\nOften the bandstop filter has a very narrow bandwidth, thus it \"notches\" out a frequency component of the input signal.

    "text": "20.2 Practical Filters\nIdeal CT filters cannot be implemented in practice because they are non-causal and thus physically impossible. To see why consider the impulse response of the ideal low-pass filter:\n\\[h(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\left\\{ H(j\\omega) \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{\\-\\omega_c}^{\\omega_c} e^{j\\omega t} \\; d\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\pi t}\\sin(\\omega_c t)\\] which has nonzero values for \\(t &lt; 0\\), and thus corresponds to a non-casual system. Ideal filters also have zero phase which cannot be achieved in practice.\nPractical filters are described by a frequency response that is a ratio of two polynomials in \\(j\\omega\\), i.e. \\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{K \\cdot(j\\omega - \\beta_1)\\cdot(j\\omega - \\beta_2)\\cdots (j\\omega - \\beta_M)}{(j\\omega - \\alpha_1)\\cdot(j\\omega - \\alpha_2)\\cdots (j\\omega - \\alpha_N)}\\] where \\(K\\) is a constant that controls the gain at DC, and the zero or more complex coefficients \\(\\beta_k\\) and the one or more complex coefficients \\(\\alpha_k\\) are called the zeros and poles of the filter respectively. Such systems correspond to differential equations as we have covered before and are physically realizable as circuits if all poles and zeros are real or come in conjugate pairs. The processes of designing filters consists of choosing the poles and zeros, or equivalently choosing the coefficients of the numerator and dominator polynomials. This is covered in ECE 3704, ECE 4624, and other upper-level courses.\nPractical filters differ from ideal filters in that they cannot be zero over any finite range of frequencies and cannot transition discontinuously between stop and pass bands. Instead they must vary over the bands and transition smoothly, with a degree of variation and sharpness that is a function of the order of the filter and the exact form of the frequency response polynomials. Thus practical filters are described by additional parameters that define the stop and pass-bands.\nThe overall gain of the filter is the magnitude of the frequency response at a frequency that depends on the filter type, zero for a low-pass filter and the center frequency for a band-pass filter. The pass-band is defined by the frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response drops below the overall gain, often -3dB = \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). The stop-band is defined similarly, as the frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response drops further below the overall gain, often -20dB = 0.1 or -40dB = 0.01. The transition bandwidth is defined as the difference in the stop-band and pass-band frequencies. The pass-band ripple is defined as the maximum deviation from the overall gain, over the pass-band.",

    "text": "20.3 First-order and second-order systems as filters\nGiven the equivalence of LTI systems and linear, constant-coefficient differential equations, block diagrams, impulse responses, and frequency responses, filters can be represented in any of these ways.\nWe have covered extensively first-order and second-order CT systems and seen how they can be represented variously as circuits, differential equations, block diagrams, and as frequency responses. We now see how they can describe simple filters and serve as building blocks for higher-order filters.\n\nConsider a low-pass filter with the desired characteristics of having a pass-band of -3dB at 1kHz, and a stop-band of -20dB at 10kHz.

At the frequency \\(2\\pi*5000 \\approx 3.14\\times 10^4\\) rad/s the response passes through about -28dB.

    "text": "20.4 Higher-Order Filters\nWe can continue to increase the steepness of the passband to stop-band transitions by increasing the order of the filter. This is typically accomplished using a serial connection of systems, called stages in filter parlance, where each stage is a first-order or second-order system.\nRecall in a series connection of systems the overall impulse response is the convolution of the individual responses. If we assume each stage is stable then, by the convolution property, the overall frequency response is given by the product of their individual frequency responses.\n\n\n\n\\[H(j\\omega) = \\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)} = H_1(j\\omega)\\cdot H_2(j\\omega)\\]\nWriting each response in polar form \\[H_1(j\\omega)\\cdot H_2(j\\omega) = |H_1(j\\omega)|\\cdot |H_2(j\\omega)| e^{\\angle H_1(j\\omega)+ \\angle H_2(j\\omega)}\\] we note that the magnitudes multiply and the phases add. That means we can use additional stages to reinforce the attenuation of previous stages. Note this requires in the circuit that the stages be impedance isolated, thus the use of the opamps at the end of CT filters. Again the price we pay for increasing the order of the filter and decreasing the transition frequency is increased phase shift in the signal.\nMatlab code for plotting the first-order example Bode plot:\nR = 99.2e3;\nC = 1.6e-9;\na = 1/(R*C);\n\nH = tf([a],[1,a]);\n[mag,ph,w] = bode(H);\n\n% Create a nice bode plot \nhFig = figure();\nhold on;\n\nsubplot(2,1,1);\nhm = semilogx(w,20*log10(squeeze(mag)));\ngrid on;\nhTitle  = title ('Frequency Response - first order');\nhYLabel1 = ylabel('Magnitude (dB)');\nset(gca, 'FontSize', 14, 'YTick', -60:10:20, ...\n    'Box', 'off', 'LineWidth', 2);\n\nsubplot(2,1,2);\nhp = semilogx(w,squeeze(ph*(pi/180)));\ngrid on;\nhYLabel2 = ylabel('Phase (radians)');\nhXLabel = xlabel('Frequency (rad/s)');\nset(gca, 'FontSize', 14, 'Box', 'off', 'LineWidth', 2);\n\nset(hm, 'linewidth', 2);\nset(hp, 'linewidth', 2);\nset([hXLabel, hYLabel1, hYLabel2]  , ...\n     'FontSize'   , 14          );\nset( hTitle                    , ...\n     'FontSize'   , 14          , ...\n     'FontWeight' , 'bold'      );\nMatlab code for plotting the second-order example Bode plot:\nR1 = 74.2e3;\nR2 = 1.33e6;\nC1 = 1.6e-9;\nC2 = 160e-12;\n\na = (R1+R2)/(R1*R2*C1);\nb = 1/(R1*R2*C1*C2);\n\nH = tf([b],[1,a,b]);\n[mag,ph,w] = bode(H);\n\n% Create a nice bode plot \nhFig = figure();\nhold on;\n\nsubplot(2,1,1);\nhm = semilogx(w,20*log10(squeeze(mag)));\ngrid on;\nhTitle  = title ('Frequency Response - second order');\nhYLabel1 = ylabel('Magnitude (dB)');\nset(gca, 'FontSize', 14, 'YTick', -90:10:20, ...\n    'Box', 'off', 'LineWidth', 2);\n\nsubplot(2,1,2);\nhp = semilogx(w,squeeze(ph*(pi/180)));\ngrid on;\nhYLabel2 = ylabel('Phase (radians)');\nhXLabel = xlabel('Frequency (rad/s)');\nset(gca, 'FontSize', 14, 'Box', 'off', 'LineWidth', 2);\n\nset(hm, 'linewidth', 2);\nset(hp, 'linewidth', 2);\n\nset([hXLabel, hYLabel1, hYLabel2]  , ...\n     'FontSize'   , 14          );\nset( hTitle                    , ...\n     'FontSize'   , 14          , ...\n     'FontWeight' , 'bold'      );",

As we shall see, the DFT/FFT is mathematically equivalent to the Discrete-Time Fourier Series. It can be viewed as a way to numerically approximate the CT Fourier transform. Lets first just state the transform and then derive it and see how to interpret and apply it.\nGiven a finite-length sequence of real or complex numbers \\(x[n]\\), indexed from \\(0\\) to \\(N-1\\), the Discrete Fourier Transform or DFT is given by \\[X[k] = \\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1}  x[n] e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi}{N}k n}\\] for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots, N-1\\).

It also admits some important applications:\n\nNumerical computation of Fourier transform of physical signals\nSimulation or approximation of stable CT systems\nImplementation of CT systems using DT systems\n\nAs an example application, suppose you have a physical signal, say an audio signal from a microphone. How would you estimate its Fourier Transform?

Given the DFT of \\(x[n]\\), \\(X[k]\\), what values of \\(k\\) correspond to \\(\\omega = \\pm 2\\pi\\)?\n\\[\\omega = 2\\pi = \\frac{2\\pi}{NT} k \\implies k = 100\\]\n\\[\\omega = - 2\\pi = \\frac{2\\pi}{NT} k \\implies k = -100\\] However \\(k \\in (0, N-1)\\) where \\(N= 100000\\). Thus \\(k = -100 = N - 100 = 99900\\). Note, the Matlab command fftshift does this unwrapping for you.\n\n\nAs another application, suppose you have a CT frequency response, \\(H(j\\omega)\\), for example a CT filter.

DT implementations of CT systems have a number of benefits over CT implementations. The previous application hints at a method to implement a CT system using a DFT. We sample \\(x(t)\\) at a frequency of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{T}\\) for \\(NT\\) seconds into a buffer, called a frame. \\[x[n] = x(nT)\\] \\[X[k] = \\text{DFT}\\left\\{ x[n] \\right\\}\\] \\[Y[k] = H\\left(e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{NT} k}\\right) X[k]\\] \\[y(t) \\approx y(nT) = \\frac{1}{T} \\text{IDFT}\\left\\{ Y[k] \\right\\}\\] This last step is called reconstruction. Note this can be done in real time using three frames, one being sampled, one being processing, and one being reconstructed.\nNote the DT filter in the previous application adds a two frame delay. This delay can be removed using an FIR or IIR filter implementation, as we saw in lecture 25. We can sample \\(x(t)\\) at a frequency of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{T}\\) continuously into a ring buffer. \\[x[n] = x(nT)\\] Compute \\(y[n]\\) using a delay difference equation, e.g. for second order \\[y[n] = a_1 y[n-2] + a_2 y[n-1] + a_3 x[n-2] + a_4 x[n-1] + a_5 x[n]\\] Reconstruct the current output \\[y(t) \\approx y(nT) = y[n]\\]",

    "section": "",
    "text": "23.1 Sampling Theory\nUp until now in the course we have focused on either CT or DT signals and systems. Practical systems though often are hybrid and require conversion between DT and CT signals. For example a CT audio signal might be converted to a DT audio signal for storage and/or transmission, and at a later time or location converted back to a CT signal for playback through a speaker.\nIt is also common to design a CT system and then implement it as a DT system. Advantages of this approach are e.g. such implementations are less susceptible to component variations, require no tuning a build time, are easier to change (firmware or software update), easier to prototype, and more easily use encryption.\nIn this lecture we focus on sampling of CT signals to produce a DT signal \\(x[n] = x(nT)\\) with sample index \\(n\\) and sample time \\(T\\). In the next lecture we consider the case of converting from a DT to CT signal.\nThe process of sampling is to produce a DT signal \\(x[n]\\) from a CT signal \\(x(t)\\) by sampling time at regular intervals \\(T\\in \\mathbb{R}^+\\) called the sample-time, or equivalently sampling at a frequency of \\(\\tfrac{1}{T}\\) Hz or \\(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{T}\\) rad/s. Mathematically this is simple to express in the time domain as \\(x[n] = x(nT)\\), however we seek a system that can perform this task.\nRecall the impulse train is the periodic signal \\[x_1(t) = \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t-nT_0)\\] with period \\(T_0\\) and frequency \\(\\omega_0 = \\tfrac{2\\pi}{T_0}\\). The exponential CT Fourier series of the impulse train is given by \\[x_1(t) = \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_n e^{j\\tfrac{2\\pi}{T_0}nt}\\] where the Fourier series coefficients are \\[a_n = \\frac{1}{T_0} \\int\\limits_{-\\frac{T_0}{2}}^{\\frac{T_0}{2}} \\delta(t) e^{-jn\\omega_0 t} \\; dt = \\frac{1}{T_0}\\] Now, lets take the Fourier Transform of the Fourier series representation \\[\\begin{aligned}\nX_1(j\\omega) &= \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{T_0} e^{j\\tfrac{2\\pi}{T_0}nt}e^{j\\omega t}\\; dt\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{T_0} \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{j\\tfrac{2\\pi}{T_0}nt}e^{j\\omega t}\\; dt\\\\\n&= \\frac{2\\pi}{T_0} \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0 n)\n\\end{aligned}\\] also an impulse train in the frequency domain. Now suppose we have another signal \\(x_2(t)\\) and we multiply \\(x_1(t)\\) and \\(x_2(t)\\) to get a signal \\(y(t)\\). \\[y(t) = x_1(t) \\cdot x_2(t) = \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_2(t) \\delta(t-nT_0) = \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_2(nT_0) \\delta(t-nT_0)\\] Since \\(y(t)\\) is non-zero only at the locations of the delta functions, we can treat \\(y(nT_0) = x_2(nT_0)\\) as the DT signal \\(x_2[n]\\). This is illustrated below\nTODO samplinf_timedomain.pdf\nEquivalently in the frequency domain the modulation theorem gives \\[y(t) = x_1(t) \\cdot x_2(t) \\stackrel{\\mathcal{F}}{\\longleftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} X_1(j\\omega) * X_2(j\\omega) = Y(j\\omega)\\] Lets do the convolution \\[\\begin{aligned}\n  Y(j\\omega) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} X_1(j\\omega) * X_2(j\\omega)\\\\\n  &=  \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[  \\frac{2\\pi}{T_0} \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0 n) \\right] * X_2(j\\omega)\\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}  \\frac{2\\pi}{T_0} \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega^\\prime - \\omega_0 n) X_2(j\\omega^\\prime) \\; d\\omega^\\prime\\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{T_0} \\sum\\limits_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X_2(j(\\omega - n\\omega_0))\n\\end{aligned}\\] Thus the sampling process in the frequency domain causes periodic replication of the Fourier transform of the signal being sampled, \\(x_2(t)\\), which are sometimes called images. This signal \\(Y(j\\omega)\\) is periodic in \\(\\omega_0 = \\tfrac{2\\pi}{T_0}\\) radians per second and corresponds to the DT Fourier Transform of \\(x_2[n]  \\stackrel{\\mathcal{F}}{\\longleftrightarrow} X_2\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)\\), which is periodic in \\(2\\pi\\) radians per sample time.\nTo help us visualize this, suppose that the signal \\(x_2(t)  \\stackrel{\\mathcal{F}}{\\longleftrightarrow} X_2(j\\omega)\\) is band-limited to \\(B\\) Hz, that is \\(X_2(j\\omega) = 0\\) for all frequencies outside the band \\(-2\\pi B &lt; \\omega &lt; 2\\pi B\\). This is shown schematically as the magnitude spectrum below:\nTODO bandlimited.pdf\nAfter sampling (\\(y(t) = x_1(t)\\cdot x_2(t)\\)) and assuming \\(\\omega_0 &gt; 4\\pi B\\) the spectrum of the sampled signal is:\nTODO bandlimitedsampled1.pdf\nIf instead \\(\\omega_0 &lt; 4\\pi B\\) the images overlap and we get aliasing, where high frequency content gets added to the lower frequency content. This is shown below with the lighter lines showing the images and the heavier line showing their sum.\nTODO bandlimitedsampled2.pdf\nAs we will see next time, to reconstruct the signal \\(x_2[n]\\) back to \\(x_2(t)\\) we need to ensure that \\(\\omega_0 &gt; 4\\pi B\\) rad/s or equivalently \\(f_0 &gt; 2 B\\) Hz, which requires the sample time \\(T_0 &lt; \\tfrac{1}{2B}\\) seconds. This is called the Nyquist sample rate/frequency.",

    "section": "23.2 Practical Sampling",
    "text": "23.2 Practical Sampling\nSampling in practice requires addressing three issues. First, we cannot generate the impulse train, but can only approximate it. Second, digital signals must have a fixed bit width so we have to convert the real signal value to a quantized one. Lastly, since in general we have no control over the input signal means we need to ensure the signal is approximately band-limited before sampling.\n\n23.2.1 Sample and Hold\nSampling is typically accomplished using a circuit called a sample-and-hold, schematically illustrated below.\nTODO smaple_hold.pdf\nThe CT signal is applied to the input of the first op-amp buffer. The output of this first buffer is switched into a charging capacitor for the sample time, then disconnected (high impedance) at regular intervals for the hold time, typically using a MOSFET switch. The effect is the capacitor is charged to the current value of \\(x(t)\\) during the sample-time, which it maintains during the hold-time, the value of which is bufered by the second op-amp. This can be mathematically modeled as a pulse train with a width equal to the sample time rather than as an impulse train.\n\n\n23.2.2 Quantization\nTo quantize the signal after the sample-and-hold into \\(N\\) bits, several strategies can be used. One popular approach is called successive approximation, illustrated below\nTODO sar.pdf\nThe current quantized digital value is held in a counter connected to a clock signal. The direction of the counter (up or down) is controlled by a comparator connected to the output of the sample and hold and the current counter output and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, usually a resistor ladder) that converts it back to an analog value. If the DAC value is less than the held value, the counter counts up, if the DAC value is greater than the held value the counter counts down. In this fashion the counter output tracks the held value after a settling time required for convergence, at which point the counter value is clocked into a register for storage.\n\n\n23.2.3 Anti-aliasing\nBefore the sample and hold we need to include a filter to limit the bandwidth. This can be accomplished by a CT low-pass filter called an anti-aliasing filter whose cutoff frequency in the ideal case is \\(\\omega_c = 2\\pi B\\). As we saw in lecture 24 ideal filters cannot be implemented, thus we specify the anti-aliasing filter as a pass-band gain/frequency and a stop-band gain/frequency. Since the transition band is non-zero for a practical filter, this means we have to either lower the pass-band relative to the ideal or increase the sample rate. In the best case, the filter should have a stop-band frequency at half the sampling frequency with the order of the filter and pass-band frequency adjusted as needed. Alternatively the gain that defines the stop-band can be relaxed. This gives a desired frequency response magnitude that looks like the following.\nTODO antialias.pdf\nThe bold dotted line shows the maximum frequency response of the first image.",

    "text": "24.1 Reconstruction Theory\nIn the previous lecture we focused on sampling of CT signals to produce a DT signal \\(x[n] = x(nT)\\) with sample index \\(n\\) and sample time \\(T\\). In this lecture we consider reconstruction, converting from a DT signal \\(x[n]\\) to a CT signal \\(x(t)\\) using a sample time \\(T\\) as the spacing between samples. Ideally a conversion from \\(x(t)\\) to \\(x[n]\\) and back again would result in identical signal.\nGiven a DT signal \\(x[n]\\) and a sample spacing \\(T\\), we can define a corresponding CT signal as \\[x_p(t) = \\sum\\limits_{n = -\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] \\, \\delta(t-nT)\\] the impulse train with each impulse weighted by the DT signal.\nCT signal reconstruction can be viewed from two different (but equivalent) perspectives. In the time domain perspective, the CT signal \\(x(t)\\) corresponding to a DT signal \\(x[n]\\) can be viewed as interpolation, where the values of the CT signal are equal to the DT signal at intervals of the sample time, i.e. \\(x(nT) = x[n]\\), and in between the value of \\(x(t)\\) is interpolated. If the interpolation is of zero-order, the value at \\(x(nT)\\) is held constant until \\(x(nT+T)\\). This is called a zero-order hold, and can mathematically modeled as convolution of the weighted impulse train with a pulse \\(p(t) = u(t) - u(t-T)\\) whose width is the sample time, called the interpolation function. \\[y(t) = p(t)*x_p(t)\\] This is illustrated below\nTODO zero-order-hold-interp\nThe zero-order hold is not a very accurate representation of a band-limited signal. So, what interpolation function is optimal?\nTo answer this question we can turn to the alternative perspective on reconstruction, that of the frequency domain. Recall the sampled signal \\(x(nT)\\) in the frequency domain can be viewed as the summation of the Fourier transform of \\(x(t)\\), \\(X(j\\omega)\\), and periodic replicas or images centered at multiples of the sampling frequency. If we assume the original signal was band-limited and sampled appropriately (using the Nyquist criteria), then if we ideal low-pass filter the sampled signal we will preserve the central portion of the Fourier spectrum that corresponds to the original signal, and chop off the images. For this reason the reconstruction filter is also called an anti-imaging filter.\nTODO bandlimitedreconstructed1.pdf\nRecall filtering is multiplication the frequency domain and convolution in the time domain, so the optimal interpolation function corresponds to the impulse response of the ideal low-pass filter with cutoff frequency \\(\\omega_c = 2\\pi B\\), a sinc function.\n\\[h(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\left\\{ H(j\\omega) \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int\\limits_{-\\omega_c}^{\\omega_c} e^{j\\omega t} \\; d\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\pi t}\\sin(\\omega_c t)\\]\nThus the ideal ideal interpolation function is the sinc function, and reconstruction is low-pass filtering of the weighted impulse train \\(x_p(t)\\) 1.",

Consider a digital output with \\(N\\) bits and a reference voltage \\(V_{ref}\\) (for example an 8-bit output port on a micro-controller using CMOS 3.3v logic).\nIf this port is connected to a resistor network consisting of resistor values \\(R\\) and \\(2R\\) as follows\nTODO resistor-ladder.pdf\nthen depending on the bit pattern at the output port \\(V\\), the output of the buffer op-amp will be \\[V_o = V_{ref}\\frac{V}{2^N}\\]\nIf the port value is changed every sample time \\(T\\), then the resister ladder and buffer op-amp combine to implement a zero-order hold circuit.\n\n\n24.2.2 Reconstruction(anti-imaging) filter\nThe zero-order hold is followed by the reconstruction (anti-imaging) filter which low-pass filters the output and smooths-out the jumps from value to value.\nTODO sinc-interp.pdf\nIn general the reconstruction filter is of a similar, or identical form to the anti-aliasing filter.",
