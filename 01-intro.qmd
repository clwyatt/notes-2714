title: "Course Introduction"
---

The concepts and techniques in this course are probably the most useful
in engineering. A *signal* is a function of one or more independent
variables conveying information about a physical (or virtual) phenomena.
A *system* may respond to signals to produce other signals, or produce
signals directly.

This course is about the mathematical models and related techniques for
the design and understanding of systems as signal transformations. We
focus on a broadly useful class of systems, known as *linear,
time-invariant systems*. You will learn about:

-   the representation and analysis of signals as information carrying
    channels

-   and how to analyze and implement linear, time-invariant systems to
    transform those signals.

## Example Signals and Systems

**Electrical Circuits.** This is a Sallen-Key filter, a second-order system
commonly use to select frequencies from a signal:

![A circuit that implements a Sallen-Key filter.](figures/fig1_2){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Diagram showing a circuit corresponding to a Sallen-Key filter."}

There are two signals we can easily identify, the input signal as the
voltage applied across $x(t)$, and the output voltage measured across
$y(t)$. We build on your circuits course by viewing this circuit as an
implementation of a more abstract linear system. We see how it can be
viewed as a frequency selective filter. We will see how to answer
questions such as: how do we choose the values of the resistors and
capacitors to select the frequencies we are interested in? and how do we
determine what those frequencies are?

**Robotic Joint.** This is a Linear, Time-Invariant model of a DC motor, a
mixture of electrical and mechanical components.

![A model of a DC motor.](figures/fig1_3){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Diagram showing a model of a DC motor."}

How do we convert the motor into a servo for use in a robotic joint?
What are its characteristics (e.g. how fast can it move)?

**Audio Processing.** Suppose you record an interview for a podcast, but
during an important part of the discussion, the HVAC turns on and there
is an annoying noise in the background.

![A plot of a noisy signal in the time domain.](images/noisysignal){fig-alt="A plot of a noisy signal in the time domain."}

How could you remove the noise minimizing distortion to the rest of the
audio?

**Communications.** Consider a wireless sensor, that needs to transmit to a
base station, e.g. a wireless mic system.

![Diagram illustrating a wireless transmitter and reciever.](figures/fig1_4){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Diagram illustrating a wireless transmitter and reciever."}

How should the signal be processed so it can be transmitted? How should
the received signal be processed?

## Types of Problems

Applications of this material occur in all areas of science and
engineering. When we have a measured output but are unsure what
combination of inputs and system components could have produced it, we
have a *modeling* problem.

![A Modeling Problem](figures/fig1_5){fig-align="center" fig-alt="a block diagram showing an unknown system and input, but known output y"}

Models are the bedrock of the scientific method and are required to
apply the concepts of this course to engineering problems.

When we know the input and the system description and desire to know the
output we have an *analysis* problem.

![An Analysis Problem](figures/fig1_6){fig-align="center" fig-alt="a block diagram showing a known input and system, but unknown label"}


Analysis problems are the kind you have encountered most often already.
For example, given an electrical circuit and an applied voltage or
current, what are the voltages and currents across and through the
various components.

When we know either the input and desired output and seek the system to
perform this transformation,

![An System Identification Problem](figures/fig1_7){fig-align="center" fig-alt="a block diagram showing unknown system, but known input and output"}

or we know the system description and output and desire the input that
would generate the output,

![An Input Identification Problem](figures/fig1_8){fig-align="center" fig-alt="a block diagram showing unknown input, but known system and output."}

we have a *design problem* or *identification problem*.

This course focuses on modeling and analysis with applications to
electrical circuits and devices for measurement and control of the
physical world and is broadly applicable to all ECE majors. Some
Examples:

-   Controls, Robotics, & Autonomy: LTI systems theory forms the basis
    of perception and control of machines.

-   Communications & Networking: LTI systems theory forms the basis of
    transmission and reception of signals, e.g. AM and FM radio.

-   Machine Learning: LTI systems are often used to pre-process samples
    or to create basis functions to improve learning.

-   Energy & Power Electronic Systems: linear circuits are often modeled
    as LTI systems.

Subsequent courses, e.g. ECE 3704, focus more on analysis and design.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives (LOs) for the course are:

1.  Describe a given system using a block-level description and identify
    the input/output signals.

2.  Mathematically model continuous and discrete linear, time-invariant
    systems using differential and difference equations respectively.

3.  Analyze the use of filters and their interpretation in the time and
    frequency domains and implement standard filters in hardware and/or
    software.

4.  Apply computations of the four fundamental Fourier transforms to the
    analysis and design of linear systems.

5.  Communicate solutions to problems and document projects within the
    domain of signals and systems through formal written documents.

These are broken down further into the following topic learning
objectives (TLOs). The TLOs generally map onto one class meeting but are
used extensively in later TLOs.

TLO 2:  Continuous-time (CT) signals (OW §1.1 through 1.4 and 2.5): A
    continuous-time (CT) signal is a function of one or more independent
    variables conveying information about a physical phenomena. This
    lecture gives an introduction to continuous-time signals as
    functions. You learn how to characterize such signals in a number of
    ways and are introduced to two very important signals: the unit
    impulse and the complex exponential.
