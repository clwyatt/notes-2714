# Course Introduction

The concepts and techniques in this course are probably the most useful
in engineering. A *signal* is a function of one or more independent
variables conveying information about a physical (or virtual) phenomena.
A *system* may respond to signals to produce other signals, or produce
signals directly.

This course is about the mathematical models and related techniques for
the design and understanding of systems as signal transformations. We
focus on a broadly useful class of systems, known as *linear,
time-invariant systems*. You will learn about:

-   the representation and analysis of signals as information carrying
    channels

-   and how to analyze and implement linear, time-invariant systems to
    transform those signals.

## Example Signals and Systems

**Electrical Circuits.** This is a Sallen-Key filter, a second-order system
commonly use to select frequencies from a signal:

```{.tikz}

\begin{circuitikz}[american voltages,scale=1.0, every node/.style={transform shape}]
      \draw
      (7,3.5) node[op amp] (opamp1) {}
      (0,4) to[R,l=$R_1$,o-] (2,4)
      (2,4) to[short] (2,5)
      (2,5) to[C,l=$C_1$] (8.2,5)
      (8.2,5) to[short] (opamp1.out) 
      (2,4) to[R, l=$R_2$] (4,4)
      (4,4) to[C, l=$C_2$] (4,0)
      (0,0) to[short,o-o] (12,0)
      (4,4) to[short] (opamp1.-)
      (opamp1.+) to[short] (5.8,1.75)
      (5.8,1.75) to[short] (8.2,1.75)
      (opamp1.out) to[R, l=$(1-\beta)R$] (8.2,1.75)
      (8.2,1.75) to[R, l=$\beta R$] (8.2,0)
      (opamp1.out) to[short, -o] (12,3.5)
      (0,4) to[open, v=$x(t)$] (0,0)
      (12,3.5) to[open, v=$y(t)$] (12,0);
\end{circuitikz}
```

There are two signals we can easily identify, the input signal as the
voltage applied across $x(t)$, and the output voltage measured across
$y(t)$. We build on your circuits course by viewing this circuit as an
implementation of a more abstract linear system. We see how it can be
viewed as a frequency selective filter. We will see how to answer
questions such as: how do we choose the values of the resistors and
capacitors to select the frequencies we are interested in? and how do we
determine what those frequencies are?

How do we convert the motor into a servo for use in a robotic joint?
What are its characteristics (e.g. how fast can it move)?

## Types of Problems

Applications of this material occur in all areas of science and
engineering. When we have a measured output but are unsure what
combination of inputs and system components could have produced it, we
have a *modeling* problem.

```{.tikz}
%%| filename: figure1-5
%%| fig-align: center
%%| alt: Block diagram showing an unknown system and input, but known output y

\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,decorations.pathreplacing}
     \tikzstyle{block} = [draw, fill=gray!20, rectangle, 
      minimum height=3em, minimum width=3em]
    \tikzstyle{sum} = [draw, fill=gray!20, circle, node distance=1cm]
    \tikzstyle{input} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{output} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{pinstyle} = [pin edge={to-,thin,black}]

  \begin{tikzpicture}[auto, scale=1.2, node distance=3cm,>=latex']
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [block, right of=input] (system) {?};
    \node [output, right of=system] (output) {};

    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {Input?} (system);
    \draw [->] (system) -- node {Output $y$} (output);
  \end{tikzpicture}

```

Models are the bedrock of the scientific method and are required to
apply the concepts of this course to engineering problems.

When we know the input and the system description and desire to know the
output we have an *analysis* problem.

```{.tikz}
%%| filename: figure1-6
%%| fig-align: center
%%| alt: Block diagram showing a known input and system, but unknown label.

\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,decorations.pathreplacing}
     \tikzstyle{block} = [draw, fill=gray!20, rectangle, 
      minimum height=3em, minimum width=3em]
    \tikzstyle{sum} = [draw, fill=gray!20, circle, node distance=1cm]
    \tikzstyle{input} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{output} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{pinstyle} = [pin edge={to-,thin,black}]

  \begin{tikzpicture}[auto, scale=1.2, node distance=3cm,>=latex']
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [block, right of=input] (system) {System $T$};
    \node [output, right of=system] (output) {};

    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {Input $x$} (system);
    \draw [->] (system) -- node {Output?} (output);
\end{tikzpicture}

```

Analysis problems are the kind you have encountered most often already.
For example, given an electrical circuit and an applied voltage or
current, what are the voltages and currents across and through the
various components.

When we know either the input and desired output and seek the system to
perform this transformation,

```{.tikz}
%%| filename: figure1-7
%%| fig-align: center
%%| alt: Block diagram showing unknown system, but known input and output.

\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,decorations.pathreplacing}
     \tikzstyle{block} = [draw, fill=gray!20, rectangle, 
      minimum height=3em, minimum width=3em]
    \tikzstyle{sum} = [draw, fill=gray!20, circle, node distance=1cm]
    \tikzstyle{input} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{output} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{pinstyle} = [pin edge={to-,thin,black}]

  \begin{tikzpicture}[auto, scale=1.2, node distance=3cm,>=latex']
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [block, right of=input] (system) {System?};
    \node [output, right of=system] (output) {};

    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {Input $x$} (system);
    \draw [->] (system) -- node {Output $y$} (output);
  \end{tikzpicture}

```

or we know the system description and output and desire the input that
would generate the output,

```{.tikz}
%%| filename: figure1-8
%%| fig-align: center
%%| alt: Block diagram showing unknown input, but known system and output.

\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,decorations.pathreplacing}
     \tikzstyle{block} = [draw, fill=gray!20, rectangle, 
      minimum height=3em, minimum width=3em]
    \tikzstyle{sum} = [draw, fill=gray!20, circle, node distance=1cm]
    \tikzstyle{input} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{output} = [coordinate]
    \tikzstyle{pinstyle} = [pin edge={to-,thin,black}]

  \begin{tikzpicture}[auto, scale=1.2, node distance=3cm,>=latex']
    \node [input, name=input] {};
    \node [block, right of=input] (system) {System $T$};
    \node [output, right of=system] (output) {};

    \draw [draw,->] (input) -- node {Input?} (system);
    \draw [->] (system) -- node {Output $y$} (output);
  \end{tikzpicture}
```

we have a *design problem*.

This course focuses on modeling and analysis with applications to
electrical circuits and devices for measurement and control of the
physical world and is broadly applicable to all ECE majors. Some
Examples:

-   Controls, Robotics, & Autonomy: LTI systems theory forms the basis
    of perception and control of machines.

-   Communications & Networking: LTI systems theory forms the basis of
    transmission and reception of signals, e.g. AM and FM radio.

-   Machine Learning: LTI systems are often used to pre-process samples
    or to create basis functions to improve learning.

-   Energy & Power Electronic Systems: linear circuits are often modeled
    as LTI systems.

Subsequent courses, e.g. ECE 3704, focus more on analysis and design.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives (LOs) for the course are:

1.  Describe a given system using a block-level description and identify
    the input/output signals.

2.  Mathematically model continuous and discrete linear, time-invariant
    systems using differential and difference equations respectively.

3.  Analyze the use of filters and their interpretation in the time and
    frequency domains and implement standard filters in hardware and/or
    software.

4.  Apply computations of the four fundamental Fourier transforms to the
    analysis and design of linear systems.

5.  Communicate solutions to problems and document projects within the
    domain of signals and systems through formal written documents.

These are broken down further into the following topic learning
objectives (TLOs). The TLOs generally map onto one class meeting but are
used extensively in later TLOs.

## Graphical Outline

![](graphics/system-representations-fig.svg){fig-alt="A hierarchical diagram showing the two main types of system representations, those in the time domain and those in the frequency domain. Under the time domain are differential and difference equations, impulse response, and circuit or block diagrams. Under frequency domain methods are the frequency response and the Eigenvalue or Transfer function representation."}

![](graphics/analysis-methods-fig.svg){fig-alt="A hierarchical diagram showing the corresponding analysis methods in the previous figure. For time domain we have solving differential or difference equations, or using convolution. For the frequency domain we have the Fourier series, Fourier transform, or the Eigenvalue analysis (for sinusoidal inputs)"}
