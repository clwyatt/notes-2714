title: "6. Linear Time Invariant CT Systems"

abstract: |
   Today's topic is our introduction to CT systems and the important case of CT Linear, Time-Invariant Systems.

## System types

A system is an interconncted set of components or sub-systems. Mathematically a system is a transformation between one or more signals, a rule that maps functions to functions.

* single input - single output (SISO) system.

* single input - multiple output (SIMO) system

* general case, multiple input - multiple output (MIMO)

We will focus on single input - single output, CT and DT systems.
