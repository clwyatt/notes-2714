title: "Frequency Selective Filters in CT"
---

Recall the response of stable CT LTI systems to periodic inputs. Given a
stable LTI system with frequency response $H(j\omega)$
$$x(t) = \sum\limits_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} a_k e^{jk\omega_0 t} \longrightarrow y(t) = \sum\limits_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} a_k H(jk\omega_0) e^{jk\omega_0 t}$$

Note the output is equivalent to a signal with Fourier series
coefficients $b_k = a_k H(jk\omega_0)$. That is the Fourier coefficients
are scaled by the frequency response at the harmonic frequency
$k\omega_0$.

Similarly for aperiodic signals, given a stable LTI system with
frequency response $H(j\omega)$
$$x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(j\omega) e^{j\omega t}\; d\omega \longrightarrow y(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(j\omega) H(j\omega) e^{j\omega t}\; d\omega$$

Note the output is equivalent to a signal with Fourier Transform
$Y(j\omega) = X(j\omega) H(jk\omega_0)$. That is the Fourier transform
at each continuous frequency $\omega$ is scaled by the frequency
response at that frequency.

We can use this behavior to our advantage. In many applications we want
to modify the values of $a_k$ or $X(j\omega)$ selectively, passing them
unmodified, increasing (amplifying) them, or decreasing (attenuating)
them. This is accomplished by designing a frequency response. Such
systems are called frequency selective *filters* and come in 4 basic
types:

- Low-pass Filters attenuate high frequencies while passing through
  lower frequencies. They are often used to reduce the effects of
  high-frequency noise in a signal and to prepare it for sampling
  (so-called anti-aliasing filters). They are the most common filter.

- High-pass Filters attenuate lower frequencies while passing through
  higher frequencies. While less common, they are often used to remove
  the DC component ($\omega$ = 0) of a signal and to compute the
  derivative of a signal.

- Bandpass Filters attenuate frequencies outside a band of frequencies.
  They can be viewed as a combination of a high-pass and low-pass
  filter. They are commonly used to select a range of frequencies for
  further processing and are central to many communication technologies.

- Notch or Bandstop Filters attenuate frequencies inside an often narrow
  band of frequencies. Common applications are the removal of one or
  more corrupting signals mixed into another signal.

While the design of such filters is outside the scope of this course,
you are now equipped to understand and apply them based on your
knowledge of the Fourier methods covered over the past several weeks.

## Ideal Filters

The above filter types each have an ideal (although unrealizable) form.

Low-pass filters remove frequency content above a threshold, $\omega_c$,
called the *cutoff frequency*. They have an ideal frequency response
$$H(j\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
  1 & -\omega_c < \omega < \omega_c\\
  0 & \text{else}
\end{array}
\right.$$ with magnitude and phase plot

![Illustration of the ideal lowpass filter frequency response.](figures/fig20_1){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

The range of frequencies below $|\omega_c|$ are called the pass-band.
The range of frequencies above $|\omega_c|$ are called the stop-band.

High-pass filters remove frequency content below the cutoff frequency
$\omega_c$. They have an ideal frequency response
$$H(j\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
  0 & -\omega_c < \omega < \omega_c\\
  1 & \text{else}
\end{array}
\right.$$ with magnitude and phase plot

![Illustration of the ideal highpass filter frequency response.](figures/fig20_2){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

The range of frequencies above $|\omega_c|$ are called the pass-band.
The range of frequencies below $|\omega_c|$ are called the stop-band.

Bandpass filters remove frequency content outside a band of frequencies
called the pass-band. They have an ideal frequency response
$$H(j\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
  1 & -\omega_0 - \frac{B}{2} < \omega < -\omega_0+\frac{B}{2}\\[1em]
  1 & \omega_0 -\frac{B}{2} < \omega < \omega_0+\frac{B}{2}\\[1em]
  0 & \text{else}
\end{array}
\right.$$ where $\omega_0$ is the *center frequency* and $B$ is the
*bandwidth*. The frequencies outside this range are in the stop-band.
The magnitude and phase plot looks like

![Illustration of the ideal bandpass filter frequency response.](figures/fig20_3){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

Finally, notch or bandstop filters remove frequency content inside a
band of frequencies (the stop band) defined by the center frequency
$\omega_0$ and bandwidth $B$. The ideal frequency response is
$$H(j\omega) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
  0 & -\omega_0 - \frac{B}{2} < \omega < -\omega_0+\frac{B}{2}\\[1em]
  0 & \omega_0 -\frac{B}{2} < \omega < \omega_0+\frac{B}{2}\\[1em]
  1 & \text{else}
\end{array}
\right.$$ with magnitude and phase plot

![Illustration of the ideal bandstop filter frequency response.](figures/fig20_4){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

Often the bandstop filter has a very narrow bandwidth, thus it
\"notches\" out a frequency component of the input signal. A related filter with many notches at multiple frequencies (often harmonics) is called a *comb* filter.

## Practical Filters

Ideal CT filters cannot be implemented in practice because they are
non-causal and thus physically impossible. To see why consider the
impulse response of the ideal low-pass filter:

$$h(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left\{ H(j\omega) \right\} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int\limits_{-\omega_c}^{\omega_c} e^{j\omega t} \; d\omega = \frac{1}{\pi t}\sin(\omega_c t)$$
which has nonzero values for $t < 0$, and thus corresponds to a
non-casual system. Ideal filters also have zero phase which cannot be
achieved in practice.

Practical filters are described by a frequency response that is a ratio
of two polynomials in $j\omega$, i.e.
$$H(j\omega) = \frac{K \cdot(j\omega - \beta_1)\cdot(j\omega - \beta_2)\cdots (j\omega - \beta_M)}{(j\omega - \alpha_1)\cdot(j\omega - \alpha_2)\cdots (j\omega - \alpha_N)}$$
where $K$ is a constant that controls the gain at DC, and the zero or
more complex coefficients $\beta_k$ and the one or more complex
coefficients $\alpha_k$ are called the *zeros* and *poles* of the filter
respectively. Such systems correspond to differential equations as we
have covered before and are physically realizable as circuits if all
poles and zeros are real or come in conjugate pairs. The processes of
designing filters consists of choosing the poles and zeros, or
equivalently choosing the coefficients of the numerator and dominator
polynomials. This is covered in ECE 3704, ECE 4624, and other
upper-level courses.

Practical filters differ from ideal filters in that they cannot be zero
over any finite range of frequencies and cannot transition
discontinuously between stop and pass bands. Instead they must vary over
the bands and transition smoothly, with a degree of variation and
sharpness that is a function of the order of the filter and the exact
form of the frequency response polynomials. Thus practical filters are
described by additional parameters that define the stop and pass-bands.

The overall gain of the filter is the magnitude of the frequency
response at a frequency that depends on the filter type, zero for a
low-pass filter and the center frequency for a band-pass filter. The
pass-band is defined by the frequency at which the magnitude of the
frequency response drops below the overall gain, often -3dB =
$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. The stop-band is defined similarly, as the
frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response drops further
below the overall gain, often -20dB = 0.1 or -40dB = 0.01. The
*transition bandwidth* is defined as the difference in the stop-band and
pass-band frequencies. The *pass-band ripple* is defined as the maximum
deviation from the overall gain, over the pass-band.

## First-order and second-order systems as filters

Given the equivalence of LTI systems and linear, constant-coefficient
differential equations, block diagrams, impulse responses, and frequency
responses, filters can be represented in any of these ways.

We have covered extensively first-order and second-order CT systems and
seen how they can be represented variously as circuits, differential
equations, block diagrams, and as frequency responses. We now see how
they can describe simple filters and serve as building blocks for
higher-order filters.

Consider a low-pass filter with the desired characteristics of having a
pass-band of -3dB at 1kHz, and a stop-band of -20dB at 10kHz. Suppose
this is implemented as a first-order \"Butterworth\" filter, which can
be realized by an RC circuit.

![First order lowpass filter circuit.](figures/fig20_5){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

where $R=99.2k\Omega$ and $C=1.6$nF. This is equivalent to the
differential equation $$\frac{dy}{dt}(t) + a y(t) = a x(t)$$ where
$a=\frac{1}{RC}$, or the block diagram

![First order lowpass filter as a block diagram.](figures/fig20_6){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

This system has the impulse response $$h(t) = ae^{-at}u(t)$$ and the
frequency response $$H(j\omega) = \frac{a}{j\omega + a}$$ If we plot the
frequency response as a Bode plot, we see the DC gain is 0dB, and the
response passes through -3dB and -20dB at the expected frequencies
$2\pi*1000 \approx 6.3\times 10^3$ rad/s and
$2\pi*10000 \approx 6.3\times 10^4$ rad/s. Thus the transition bandwidth
is 9kHz, assuming a stop-band gain of -20 dB.

Suppose we wish to sharpen the transition band for the previous example
so that has a pass-band of -3dB at 1kHz, and a narrower stop-band of
-20dB at 5kHz. This requires a second-order filter, and can be realized
by a circuit called the Sallen-Key.

![Second order lowpass filter circuit.](figures/fig20_7){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

where $R_1=74.2k\Omega$, $R_2=91.3M\Omega$, $C_1=1.6$nF and $C_2=160$pF.
This is equivalent to the differential equation
$$\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}(t) + 2\alpha \frac{dy}{dt}(t) + \omega_0^2 y(t) = \omega_0^2 x(t)$$
where
$$\alpha = \frac{R_1+R_2}{2R_1 R_2 C_1} \;\text{ and }\; \omega_0^2 = \frac{1}{R_1 R_2 C_1 C_2}$$
or the block diagram

![Second order lowpass filter as a block diagram.](figures/fig20_8){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

This system has the frequency response
$$H(j\omega) = \frac{\omega_0^2}{\omega_0^2-\omega^2 + j2\alpha\omega}$$

If we plot the frequency response as a Bode plot using the resistor and
capacitor values above, we see the DC gain is 0dB, and the response
passes through -3dB at the expected frequency
$2\pi*1000 \approx 6.3\times 10^3$ rad/s. At the frequency
$2\pi*5000 \approx 3.14\times 10^4$ rad/s the response passes through
about -28dB. Thus this circuit has a transition bandwidth even narrower
than that designed (it is slightly better).

Note the price we pay for this decreased transition bandwidth is a
larger phase shift (and two more circuit components).

## Higher-Order Filters

We can continue to increase the steepness of the passband to stop-band
transitions by increasing the order of the filter. This is often
accomplished using a serial connection of systems, called *stages* in
filter parlance, where each stage is a first-order or second-order
system, although there are other approaches.

Recall in a series connection of systems the overall impulse response is
the convolution of the individual responses. If we assume each stage is
stable then, by the convolution property, the overall frequency response
is given by the product of their individual frequency responses.

![Higher order filter as a series connection of filters shown as a block diagram.](figures/fig20_9){fig-align="center" fig-alt="See the caption."}

$$H(j\omega) = \frac{Y(j\omega)}{X(j\omega)} = H_1(j\omega)\cdot H_2(j\omega)$$

Writing each response in polar form
$$H_1(j\omega)\cdot H_2(j\omega) = |H_1(j\omega)|\cdot |H_2(j\omega)| e^{\angle H_1(j\omega)+ \angle H_2(j\omega)}$$
we note that the magnitudes multiply and the phases add. That means we
can use additional stages to reinforce the attenuation of previous
stages. Note this requires in the circuit that the stages be impedance
isolated, thus the use of the opamps at the end of CT filters. Again the
price we pay for increasing the order of the filter and decreasing the
transition frequency is increased phase shift in the signal.
